This question has attracted much attention
Section  shows that the exponential error bound obtained in  CITATION  is sharp in general

Even though BMRM solves an expensive optimization problem at every iteration, the convergence analysis only uses a simple one-dimensional line search to bound the decrease in  SYMBOL
therefore, one strategy for investigating whether the problem of pro-social versus selfish behavior resembles one of self-control is to test whether the tendency to apply self-control strategies is positively associated with pro-social behavior when individuals have identified self-control conflict, but less so or not at all when individuals have not

One weakness of existing studies has been that induction therapy consisted of standard three-drug antiretroviral therapy regimens in common clinical use at the time of the study, under conditions now recognized to permit subclinical viral replication CITATION, CITATION.
however, those tests were criticized because they had characteristics that might "trigger" use of other heuristics
The only necessary assumption is that the true distribution  SYMBOL  is contained in the model class, ie that we are dealing with  proper learning

In many cases however, the Bayes mixture is computationally infeasible, and even a sophisticated approximation is expensive

These findings demonstrate that STDP and theta coded neural dynamics are compatible with rate-coded auto-associative network models of hippocampal function.
Section  treats the universal setup
It has been demonstrated  CITATION , that for both Bayes mixture and MDL, the proper learning assumption can be essential: If it is violated, then learning may fail very badly
Most generalization bounds in learning theory are based on some measure of the complexity of the hypothesis class used, such as the VC-dimension, covering numbers, or Rademacher complexity
anchoring thus appears to be a very robust psychological phenomenon
This prior explains the fact that pathways are fundamentally related: some are involved in transcription, some in signaling, some in synthesis
A simple approach is to add noise sources to deterministic models.
specifically  we hypothesize that the judgments of those individuals high in this trait will be more influenced by previously presented anchors whereas those individuals low in this trait will be less influenced by the anchor.
an emerging literature on the "default" response in games of trust and reciprocity lends further credence to the notion that altruistic responses require self-control
This impressive growth has resulted in a heterogenous and highly complex system that challenges accurate and realistic modeling of the Internet infrastructure
Applications of  SYMBOL s arise in the propositional logic, database and graph theory, scheduling and many other areas
Factor analysis is the task of explaining data by means of a set of  latent factors
individuals scoring low tend to be less inclined to consider alternative opinions and are more steadfast in their own beliefs  CITATION  making them more likely to rely upon information that is familiar and conventional  CITATION
punishing injustice is therefore considered to be a moral act, particularly when it is performed on behalf of others  CITATION
Thus, categorizing different types of ASes in the Internet is necessary to identify network evolution patterns and develop accurate evolution models
