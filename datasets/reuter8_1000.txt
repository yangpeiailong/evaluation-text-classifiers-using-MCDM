new leader coming to u s sec in challenging era president reagan s nominee as top policeman for the nation s securities markets will inherit an agency challenged by an insider trading scandal wild stock price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the globalization of financial markets david ruder a year old republican law professor at northwestern university in evanston ill was named thursday to be the rd chairman of the five member u s securities and exchange commission if confirmed by the senate as expected he will succeed john shad who left the agency earlier this week after a record six years as chairman to become ambassador to the netherlands the sec has been in the limelight for the past year as its investigators have probed into the most colossal insider trading scandal ever uncovered on wall street the investigation which is still active mushroomed in recent months as a growing number of well known traders and prominent investment banking firms have been charged with wrongdoing the pace of the probe picked up markedly in november after ivan boesky one of wall street s most successful stock speculators agreed to cooperate with government investigators and to pay a record mln dlrs in penalties and illegal profits after being charged with insider trading but the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices spurred by computer driven trading strategies that span markets in securities options and futures the price gyrations have combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented volatility to some u s securities markets at the same time the sec is being pressed by some lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers steadily reshapes the u s corporate landscape and the agency is being pushed by u s and foreign exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork for an international securities marketplace in which trading occurs across borders throughout the world around the clock such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment opportunities but could strain the sec s ability to enforce u s securities laws and guard investors from fraud under the leadership of shad the sec eased financial disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies eliminated many minor investor protection rules attempted to spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency s review of hostile corporate takeovers shad who had been vice chairman of the e f hutton investment banking firm brought a wall street perspective to the agency upon being named chairman in in line with the views of other top administration officials he favored marketplace determination of takeover battles over new federal regulations the sec under shad also stressed prosecution of insider trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that topped the agency s enforcement agenda during the administration of president jimmy carter a democrat securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with ruder say the new chairman designate is unlikely to significantly alter the commission s current priorities the sec currently has about employees most of them lawyers and an annual budget of about mln dlrs though that figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff the agency is one of the few in the government that actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past few years because of fees it charges public companies investment banks and other securities firms it regulates the sec is structured as an independent regulatory agency meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the president to fixed five year terms and protected from firing for policy differences alone by law no more than three commissioners may be of the same political party and the agency prepares its own budget request each year instead of leaving this to the white house established by congress in the sec traces its origins to the great stock market crash of which was attributed in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted market manipulations by large investment firms the agency requires public companies and investment vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on their financial condition and to disclose changes in their condition any time they issue new securities it requires brokers dealers and investment banks to register with it and comply with investor protection rules and it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices its first chairman was joseph kennedy an industrial magnate who was also the father of john kennedy later to become the nation s th president

soviet grains seen entering spring on shaky note soviet winter grains could be off to a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter weather and crop analysts said prospects for another near record grain harvest in the soviet union appear dim at this point but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems analysts said but the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the soviet grain supply and future buying plans analysts of the soviet union said from a weather standpoint you can say with certainty that the soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a lower crop than last year gail martell chief meteorologist for e f hutton said the next six weeks in the ussr s grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops martell and other analysts said where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us an agriculture department authority on the ussr said the soviet union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill this would be equal to about pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years the usda analyst said with a timely spring soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops sometimes as much as pct lower normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures this winter however snowcover in soviet grain areas has generally been excellent so the bulk of winterkill analysts speculate likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination fall dryness may be a problem there s a good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness martell said precipitation last fall was as little as pct of normal in southern and northern ukraine and below normal over the entire winter crop area she said recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice crusting and winterkill jim candor senior forecaster for accu weather said livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter analysts said the dry fall damaged pastures the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would require longer off pasture feeding they said the soviets are not in a desperate situation they don t have to buy grains now a usda official said but if the soviets are worried about their winter crops and if they feel that last year s huge crop of mln tonnes was a one time fluke brought on by perfect conditions more soviet buying might occur to insure crop supplies he said bad weather during the next six weeks could push the soviets back into the market weather analysts said a lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and a half martell said reuter

japanese tariffs seen as worldwide warning the tough trade sanctions president reagan imposed on japanese exports are not only a shot across japan s bow but also a sign reagan will attack unfair trade practices worldwide u s officials said but robert crandall a trade specialist at brookings institution a think tank said a shot across their bow can often result in a shot in our stern he said it left the united states open to retaliation the u s officials said the pct tariffs reagan ordered on mln dlrs worth of japanese goods will also show congress that a tough pro trade stand can be taken under existing laws and no new protectionist legislation is needed in the past year tough trade action had been taken against the european community over corn and sorghum taiwan over beer and wine south korea over counterfeiting of copyrights patents and trademarkets and japan on tobacco white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters the tariffs up from five pct should be seen as a serious signal to other nations on the need for fair trade practices reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers television sets and some hand tools because japan did not honor an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its markets to u s products the tariffs were placed on items which were available from other sources so there would be little effect on the american consumer fitzwater said reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action especially against japan to end global unfair trade practices and reverse the growing u s trade deficit the alternative was that if he did not congress would the u s trade gap last year was a record billion dlrs and continues to rise with japan accounting for about one third of america s overall deficit but there are other two way deficits with canada west germany taiwan and south korea and reagan officials said the president is ready to fight them all reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that i regret that these actions are necessary but that the health and vitality of the u s semiconductor industry was essential to american competitiveness in world markets we cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading practices reagan added in the statement from his california vacation home at santa barbara he said the tariffs would remain in force until japan abided by the agreement u s officials say the action today will show congress which is about to write a trade bill he does not like that he already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade the white house aide said of the tariff action it wasn t done to appease congress but because there was an unfair trade practice the aide added however on another plane it was an example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight unfair practices an that it is not necessary to make a major overall of our trade laws but the analyst crandall said the tariff action was not in the best interests of the united states and that negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue it s very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route he said because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in trade crandall said the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country and therefore its impact on congress he said i don t think it makes a lot of sense but other analysts said it made little difference whether the tariffs were aimed at u s trading partners or congress and that the main point was that the trading partners were on notice that retaliation was a weapon reagan was ready to use spokesman fitzwater said we don t want a trade war but the imposition of sanctions showed the united states would act when it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated crandall said the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country and therefore its impact on congress he said i don t think it makes a lot of sense but other analysts said it made little difference whether the tariffs were aimed at u s trading partners or congress and that the main point was that the trading partners were on notice that retaliation was a weapon reagan was ready to use spokesman fitzwater said we don t want a trade war but the imposition of sanctions showed the united states would act when it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated reuter

nigeria changes auction rules to defend the naira nigeria s central bank has changed the rules governing its foreign exchange auctions in what analysts see as a means of defending the naira currency which has depreciated steadily the bank said in a statement that from april banks bidding for foreign exchange would have to pay at the rate they offered and not as presently at the rate of the lowest successful bid made at the auction this should discourage banks from bidding high to ensure that they were successful while paying the lower marginal rate analysts said it should act as a brake because banks will know that if they bid high they will have to pay what they offered a western diplomat commented the naira has depreciated against the dollar by pct since the auctions known as the second tier foreign exchange market sfem began last september at last week s session the nigerian currency was fixed at to the dollar the third fall in a row they were clearly worried and this is the logical way of trying to stop the trend the diplomat said the central bank also announced the auctions would be fortnightly not weekly beginning on april it was not immediately clear whether next thursday s scheduled session would still take place nor if the bank was planning to double the mln dlrs which are normally on offer at each auction demand for foreign exchange has consistently outstripped supply encouraging banks to bid high and thus further weakening the naira if the normal weekly allocation is not doubled at the fortnightly session high demand could undermine the objective of the new system analysts said although bidding banks will now pay what they offered the official exchange rate for the naira applying to business transactions will continue to be the marginal rate the lowest successful bid sfem is a central part of nigeria s structural adjustment program which is considered to be the most ambitious economic recovery plan in black africa the program involves setting a realistic exchange rate for the naira which was over valued for many years liberalising imports boosting agriculture removing subsidies and reducing inefficient government participation in the economy the world bank has played a prominent part in designing this dramatic blue print and in selling it to an often sceptical public which fears inflation and lower living standards ishrat husain the world bank s representative in nigeria said yesterday he was satisfied both with the adjustment program as a whole and the foreign exchange auctions so far so good he told a meeting of bankers in lagos adding that only members of nigeria s import dependent elite would suffer hardship while the common man would benefit fears that the program would encourage inflation were incorrect he said bumper harvests had reduced rural inflation and urban prices had already reflected the naira s black market value before the currency was allowed to find its true level last september reuter
ec ministers will discuss strengthening ems float european community finance ministers and central bankers meet in belgium this weekend to discuss strengthening europe s joint currency float amid continuing worries about turbulence on foreign exchanges belgian finance minister mark eyskens who will host the informal talks told reuters the ministers and central bank chiefs would discuss the situation on currency markets in the light of the february agreement among leading industrialised countries to stabilise exchange rates around present levels in an interview eyskens said he felt the paris accord between the united states japan west germany france britain and canada had proved itself more or less workable but doubts over its effectiveness and durability have been growing since fears of a trade war between the united states and japan over computer microchips pushed the dollar to a record low against the surging yen early this week the talks at the belgian resort of knokke are being held to coordinate the ec s positions on monetary issues and third world debt ahead of the spring meetings of the international monetary fund and world bank in washington next week the ec gathering begins tonight with a dinner but the main discussions will take place tomorrow continued international currency turbulence could undermine plans for reinforcing the european monetary system the joint float holding eight ec currencies within narrow fluctuation bands which will feature high on the weekend agenda eyskens has repeatedly said that europe needs a period of calm on world currency markets and in particular a more stable dollar before it can set about strengthening the ems to make it more resilient against exchange rate swings the ems has been taking a battering over the last year as the falling dollar has sent funds surging into the dominant ems currency the west german mark forcing ministers to undertake two major realignments of parities within nine months in the interview eyskens made clear he was hoping for a wide ranging discussion on the future of the eight year old ems on the basis of proposals for bolstering it drawn up by the ec s monetary committee and the committee of central bank governors the committees were asked to come up with the proposals after the last reshuffle of ems exchange rates in january eyskens repeated calls for the european currency unit the fledgling ec currency at the core of the system to take over the mark s dominant role in the ems a proposal that has met with a cool response in west germany he said ec commission president jacques delors would report to the meeting on problems raised by plans to liberalise capital movements fully within the nation bloc by such as the need for harmonising taxes and banking controls eyskens said liberalisation of capital movements without strengthening the ems would be an element of destabilisation in the community he said the crucial issue in the debate was whether member states were willing to push further towards the ec s goal of monetary integration on the basis of an ems that included management of exchange rates by some kind of common institution instead of by national central banks as at present plans for the creation of such an institution foreseen by the ems s founding fathers have been thwarted by the reluctance of some countries notably west germany to gove up their sovereignty in the monetary field ems development has also been held up by britain s refusal so far to join the system s core exchange rate mechanism reuter

iea sees one pct growth in oecd oil demand growth in oil consumption in the western industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with pct in the international energy agency iea said oil use in the countries of the oecd increased by around one pct in first quarter to mln bpd the iea said in its monthly oil market report growth in oecd countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels as in but if average consumer prices are higher than the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year s pct it said the iea said that assuming crude oil and product prices stay close to current levels some destocking by end users can be expected if that happens natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in and there may be slightly less growth in transport fuels iea estimates on april put oil stocks in the oecd area at mln tonnes representing days of forward consumption this is about the same level as at the begining of the year the agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks it said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by mln bpd in oecd countries in the first quarter of the year this followed a small rise in january of mln bpd but a decline of mln bpd in february and mln bpd in march it is possible that final data will show a larger draw particulary for march it said as crude production also fell there is likely to have also been a decline in non reported stocks particularly at sea the iea said company stocks on land in the oecd rose to mln tonnes on april against mln on april governments built up strategic stocks to mln tonnes against mln in the period the year on year trend of government stock building is continuing with year on year company stocks also rising more or less in line with consumption after declining for five years the iea noted oil stocks on land in the u s and canada were put at mln tonnes on april down from the mln tonnes on january and equivalent to and days of consumption respectively oil stocks in western europe were mln tonnes on april down from the mln on january but still equivalent to days of consumption world oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln bpd to mln bpd from mln bpd in last quarter this drop was mostly due to a decline in opec crude production to around mln bpd in february march from mln bpd in january and to the seasonal drop in exports from centrally planned economies the iea said total opec crude oil supply was mln bpd in the first quarter plus mln bpd of ngls compared with mln bpd of crude in the last three months of and mln average for the whole of supply from non opec countries totalled mln bpd against mln bpd in the fourth quarter a drop in saudi arabian output to a tentatively forecast mln bpd in march from mln bpd in february was the largest factor behind the opec production decline the iea said saudi arabia s opec assigned output quota is mln bpd reuter
