Actually, the idea, like most good ideas, comes from Jules Verne, not _The Gods Must Be Crazy._  In one of his lesser known books (I can't remember which one right now), the protagonists are in a balloon gondola, travelling over Africa on their way around the world in the balloon, when one of them drops a fob watch.  They then speculate about the reaction of the natives to finding such a thing, dropped straight down from heaven. But the notion is not pursued further than that.  -Scott --------------------                          New .sig under construction Scott I.

Yeah, and it's also true most long complicated sequences of events, calculations, or big computer programs in general.  I don't argue that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, I just question whether you >should<.  The fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we can't model should be replaced with a random number generator.  That has been useful, for instance, in making data more palatable to human perception or for torture testing the rest of the system, but I don't think it has much to do with fractals, and I certainly would rather that the model be improved in a more explicable manner.  I guess I just haven't seen all these earth-shaking fractal models that explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists.  I really hope I do, but I'm not holding my self-similar breath.  > There is one other thing that fractals are good for:  fractal > image compression.  Uh huh.  I'll believe it when I see it.  I've been chasing fractal compression for a few years, and I still don't believe in it.  If it's so great, how come we don't see it competing with JPEG?  'Cause it can't, I'll wager.  Actually, I have wagered, I quit trying to make fractal compression work- and I was trying- because I don't think it's a reasonable alternative to other techniques.  It is neat, though. :-)  I'll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  That's why I don't think fractal compression as it is widely explained is practical.  I know Barnsley and Sloan have some tricks up their sleeves that make their demos work, but I don't see anyone using it in a real product.  It's been six years since Iterated Systems was formed, right?  	"There are always going to be questions until there's a product 	out there," Sloan replies.  The company plans to ship its first 	encoding devices in the summer, he says.  In March, Iterated 	Systems will have the other half of the system: the decoders.  		- Scientific American, March 1990, page 77  Allen B (Don't even get me started :-) )

Science Lines: 37 Distribution: usa Message-ID: <1r1099INNe68@tomato.cis.ohio-state.edu> NNTP-Posting-Host: tomato.cis.ohio-state.edu   Hi all,  I'm an assistant manager at a local art theater here in Columbus.  I'd like to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to use cue tapes to bring the houselights up.  Our current automation consoles date from the early 60's and don't provide this function.  We already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes, and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control circuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.  I've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when the cue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there's one problem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be a sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute, so to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid cuetape!)  Ideally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function. (A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film) This would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second. What I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay for around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relay is activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuit of some sort.  I'm sure some of you already have the solution figured out in your heads.  Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated!

Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can be reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at mholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.  Mark proposed this design, which he calls "Geode" ("rough on the outside, but a gem on the inside") or the "ET Strongback with integrated hab modules and centrifuge."  As you can see from file geodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much of the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The white track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte Manipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS) pod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting can occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass properties of the Station change during assembly.  The inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because it can approach closer to the Station's CG and at a structurally strong part of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are limited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the docking system.  The ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional launch mass.  We've always had the ability to put an ET into orbit (contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we've never had a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to (performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual de-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the residual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from impact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a Kevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating the local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing further micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember, it supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the nucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.  The white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment Gyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used for gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system which can be used at the end of the Station's life to perform a controlled de-orbit (so we don't kill any more kangaroos, like we did with Skylab).  The centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be used for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity on humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device for the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on one of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.  This design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical, data and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work done to date.  Mark proposed this design at Joe Shea's committee in Crystal City, and he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter seems more likely.  Please note that this text is my interpretation of Mark's design; you should see his notes in the GIF files.    Instead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these for anon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.  I'll let you all know when I get that done.  -- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office       kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368       "...Development of the space station is as inevitable as        the rising of the sun." -- Wernher von Braun

This morning I turned on my computer..to be greated with a popping noise from the monitor.  I quickly looked thru the top right vent and to my disbelief saw orange flame and smelled smoke!  Great... I opened it up to see what I could see (it's 4 years old, no warrenty for me). On one of the pc boards there was a resistor that had been majorly fryed..burnt to a crisp..can't even tell what value it is.  This is the only pjhysical damage I can find.  But to my knowledge, resistors don't just randomly blow.  What could have happened??  A voltage regulator problem..?  The fuses nearby are intact...great job.  I have 2 thoughts as to why it did this.  One, over the winter I was ruinning a humidifier for about 6 weeks, although it was halfway across the room.  Could moisture done this?  I last used it over a month ago.  Second, as most people do...I never use the power switches on the CPU or moinitor.  I have everything plugged into a surge protector and I turn the whole shebang on with it.  Now, is this bad???  Should I quit doing it?  Is my system getting too much power or varrying power this way when activated?  Now...before I take it to a repaoir shop I want to replace the resistor to see what happens.  But I have no idea what value it is.  Or even if that would fix things..would it just blow again??  Right now, when I plug it in and turn it on I don't even get the power LED..a power supply prolem?? Should I bother tracking down this resistor value or take it to a shop??  It is resistor R830.  It's near the metal shield that shgields..something..near a large black electrolytic capacitor.  It's on the right most pc board.  The monitor is an Imtec 1455N, from mid-1989. Does someone have schematics for this?  Or would someone be willing to take theirs apart and see what value R830 is???  Basically, what the hell should I do to get this thing fixed for the cheapest amont in the least time.  I have crosposted this article.  Please respond via email with any help or suggestions.  Also, does anyone have Imtecs phone or address??  My manual lacks either from what I can see.  Please respons VIA EMAIL ONLY!!! Needless to say, with no computer I don't have the leisure of scanning groups while bothering my friend to use his computer/modem. Help..this really bites and I need it working ASAP!!!

During the Pens-Devils game last night, second period, I think Kevin Stevens was in the penalty box, Nicholls punched Kjell Samuellson in the face, then raised his stick like a two handed sword to defend himself!  All Kjell could do, at 8'7" and 355 pounds, was laugh!  And speaking of Swedish Penguins defensemen, Ulf is getting a little out of hand lately.  His cheap shots are getting more frequent and more violent.  As everybody in the Meadowlands except for the officials could see last night, he rammed the butt of his stick down one of the Devil's throat.  I've always supported the argument "he does his job by being irritating," but he's starting to push it over the edge IMHO.  Of course, Holik's chop to Barrasso's neck wasn't too sportsmanlike either. It seems that he was following the "The only way to beat the Penguins is to injure them" philosophy.  As my Modern Drama professor pointed out to me the other day, Jagr was stoned pretty well Tuesday night, and last night as well, although the 30 seconds he danced around the Devils end was pretty exciting.

It was speculated at the time, that the injury was so serious that had he been playing at the other end of the rink at the time (he was playing in the same end as the ambulence is parked), he never would have survived.  Ditto, if he were playing anything other than a league with an ambulance on  standby.  If you've seen video tape of the incident, it is amazing how much blood there was.  It was literally spurting out all over the ice, as Clint grabbed his neck and watched the puddle in horror.    Amazingly enough, he made a full recovery, and played again in the NHL.  He was getting on in years at the time of the incident anyway, and didn't play for too long afterward.  Some people speculated that he just couldn't get himself back together after the incident, and I think he had a bunch of other personal problems dogging him afterward. He did eventually get back to form, and played another year or so after that, and then I believe he retired.

A Pontiac Grand Am suffers a factor of _2_ increase in price when it is exported to Japan.

(Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity since it was coined by Bnai Brith)  What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in, as far as I can get from the Arab media, is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants.  However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.  As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind.  Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true super-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the Jews used to establish their state : Religion.

Last night's game was hard fought.  The game in Chicago should have been a blow out.  All in all these two games show a different Phillies team. In past seasons they tended to always be on the short end of 1 run games.  I don't know how many times I saw them losing by only 1 run. If they were able to win most of those, they might have been more of a contending team.  They are 3-0 so far in extra innings.  And of course, they are 10-3.

This is basically a share in the Divine life.  Take a rock and make it able to talk: what God does to a human being through sanctifying grace is similar. It makes such a one able to live on a plane that is above the powers of any possible creature.  This is the "everlasting life" that the New Testament speaks of.  What Christ did when he came was to restore this life of sanctifying grace to the human race.  He instituted the Sacraments as the means by which this life is given to people, and its increase fostered.  The absence of sanctifying grace at death means automatic exclusion from Heaven.  The nature of Heaven is such that it's impossible for a human being to have any part in it without the gift of sanctifying grace.  To use my example, it would be like taking that rock and attempting to hold a conversation with it: rocks cannot talk.  Neither can human beings live in Heaven without sanctifying grace.  This all obviously applies equally well to infants or adults, since both have souls.  Infants must be baptized, therefore, or they cannot enter into Heaven.  They too need this form of life in them, or they cannot enter into Heaven.  Turning it around, infant baptism is good supporting evidence for the Catholic belief in sanctifying grace.  Unless Baptism causes some change in an infant's soul, there is no particular reason to insist on the practice.  Yet infant Baptism was probably practiced by the Apostles themselves, and was *certainly* part of the Church shortly thereafter.  There is evidence for infant Baptism in the New Testament itself: 1 Cor 1:16, Acts 16:15, 16:33, 18:8, also Acts 11:14.  It is known for sure that at least one disciple of the Apostle John was baptized as an infant: St. Polycarp (because of a remark he makes in the acts of his martyrdom).  St. Justin Martyr mentions men and women baptized as infants.  There is direct evidence in St.  Irenaeus's "Against Heresies", and in Tertullian's "On Baptism".  All these so far mentioned are in the first 170 years after our Lord's death.  After that, there starts to be tons of evidence for the practice.

The government is notoriously sloppy with physical, communications, and information security.  They can't keep their computers safe, and they're "trying".

I believe that the escrow organizations will be penetrated by foreign intelligence services within months, if not weeks, of their selection.  Private organizations that lack the resources of a full-fleged intelligence service will take longer - perhaps on the order of one to two years.

Again,  many Jewish families escaping from Nazi Armenians and Hitler's Nazi  Germany took refugee in Turkiye during the 1940's.

And one recalls that the Jews took up their abode in 'fanatic' Turkey  when they were expelled from Europe, especially Spain, by Saintly Christians,  and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and  liberty as their fellow Turkish subjects, all being exposed alike to the  rapacity of their common rulers. To one brought up, as most Americans have   been, in the Gladstonian and foreign-missionary tradition, the condition of   the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious  differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they  were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every   nation in the world would have treated as treasonable. One readily   reaches the conclusion that the Jews in Turkey were fortunate..."   He also stated that:  "they [Armenians] traitorously turned Turkish cities over to the Russian   invader; that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and  fifty thousand men to fight a civil war, and that they burned at least  a hundred Turkish villages and exterminated their population."                   TURKEY AND THE HOLOCAUST  An  interview  with  Stanford  J. Shaw  (History),  who  recently completed  two books:  The Jews  of  the Ottoman  Empire and  the Turkish Republic, and Turkey and  the Holocaust: Turkey's Role in Rescuing  Turkish  and  European  Jewry  from  Nazi  Persecution, 1933-45. Shaw  chairs the undergraduate  interdepartmental degree program in Near Eastern Studies and has organized the Program for the Study of Ottoman and Turkish Jewry. He is affiliated with the G. E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies.  Editor: How did  you come to write these two  books on Turkey and European and Turkish Jews?  Shaw: Basically, I'm  an Ottoman historian, but  I'm also Jewish. I've  spent twenty-five  years studying  Ottoman history,  and as time went along, whenever I  found materials on the Ottoman Jews, I collected  them. But  I never  did anything  with them  until a couple of years  ago, when I suddenly realized that  1992 was the 500th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  and coming  to Turkey.  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  Wilshire Avenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on Ottoman Jewry.  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated,  and I  became motivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book, The Jews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish)  Republic. This book is quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians, who tend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpoint of the Jews  and the Jewish community, and rely  mainly on Jewish sources.  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian,  and  I approach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point of view of Ottoman  society, using largely Ottoman  sources. After I finished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press,  I came  across additional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World War II. In the completed book, I had said that Turkey had done a good deal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II, but  I did  not actually have many details. Then I  found a batch of documents in the Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkish diplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust. It was too late to add this new information to the book in press, so I decided to  write a second book. I  conducted further research, mainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and the Turkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris. The result was the second book, Turkey and  the Holocaust, which details  how Turkey helped rescue Jews from the Nazis.  - How exactly did they do this?  The story takes  place over a number of years.  The book presents the material in three parts, first of which deals with the period before the Holocaust. When the Nazis  came to power in Germany in 1933,  they immediately  started  dismissing  Jews and  anti-Nazi Germans from universities,  hospitals, scientific institutes, and the like. Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of reforming its  universities, and it  saw in these Jews,  who were being fired from their positions in Germany, a good source of new talent to  help modernize the Turkish  universities. Within three months  after the  Nazis  started dismissing  these Jews,  Turkey arranged to take many of them in. They were brought to Turkey and were   given   appointments   as  professors   in   the   Turkish universities, as  heads of scientific institutes,  and as medical personnel in hospitals. About 300  to 500 major Jewish professors came to  Turkey in  the 1930s. Ernst  Reuter, a  German political scientist,  spent the  war  years teaching  political science  in Turkey. After  World War II,  he was  mayor of Berlin  during the Berlin Airlift.  Fritz Neimark, a major  German Jewish economist, came to Turkey and helped  establish a modern school of economics in Istanbul.  A man named  Reichenbach, who was rescued  from the Nazis by  Turkey and  spent the war  years in  Turkey, eventually came to  UCLA, where he  became a professor of  philosophy. Other German Jewish  emigres engaged in cultural  activities in Turkey. One  such was  Karl  Ebert,  who had  been  a leading  theatrical producer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis. He went to Turkey, where he  organized the Turkish National  Theater and the Turkish National Opera  Company in Ankara, with the  help of Paul Hindemuth. So  the first  section of the  book covers  this first phase, when Jews were being  persecuted in Germany and rescued by Turkey.  Oddly enough,  the  German emigres,  when  they were  in Turkey, did not seem to think too badly of Germany. They regarded themselves more  as Germans than Jews,  and they did not  join in the anti-Nazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community. I even  found  letters  from  the Nazi  representatives  to  Turkey praising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promoting the idea  of German  culture. Even though  these people  had been persecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks, they shared the Nazis' feelings of  Aryan racial superiority over  the Turks. The second part of the book deals  with the Holocaust, which began in 1940 when the Nazis occupied France.  In Europe at that time, and especially in France, there were  about 20,000 Turkish Jews. They had migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn of the century onward. Most of them had settled in Europe during the Turkish war for  independence after World War I,  when Greece was threatening to overrun Turkey. The Greeks had persecuted the Jews throughout the nineteenth century, and the Jews feared what might happen to them if the Greeks  took over in Turkey. Many Jews fled to France during  the 1920s and 1930s. Many  also abandoned their Turkish  citizenship and  became  French  citizens. Suddenly  the Nazis invaded France in 1940 and started introducing all sorts of anti-Jewish laws.  The Turkish  Jews soon found  that it  was not worth very much to  be a French Jew, but that it  was worth a lot to be a Turkish Jew.  - How so?  Turkey remained neutral through most of World War II. It retained its embassies  and consulates in all  the Nazi-occupied countries until it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at the end of 1944. During the war,  therefore, Turkey was in a position to  defend its  citizens  against anti-Jewish  measures, and  the actions that  Turkish diplomats took  form the second  chapter of the  book. Turkish  diplomats  who were  stationed  in France  in particular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship from the Nazis. For those Turkish  Jews who had retained their Turkish citizenship,  there  was  generally  no  problem.  If  they  were arrested and sent to a  concentration camp, the Turkish diplomats would  communicate with  the  commanders of  the  camp and  other officials and say in effect:  "These people are Turkish citizens. You  can't do  this  to  them." And  the  Turkish  Jews would  be released.  If  their  businesses were  confiscated,  the  Turkish diplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored.  The Nazis  in general  wanted to keep  the friendship  of Turkey. They hoped to be able to use  Turkey as a gateway for an invasion of the Middle  East, and they also wanted to  obtain chromium and manganese from Turkey. In order  to keep Turkish friendship, they usually accepted  these interventions on behalf  of Turkish Jews. The Turkish  diplomats sometimes went to  the concentration camps to secure the release of Turkish Jews. At times they even boarded trains hauling  Turkish Jews  to Auschwitz for  extermination and succeeded in getting them off the train. Most of the foreign Jews were sent  to a concentration  camp at  a place called  Drancy in Paris,  and that's  where  most of  the  intercession by  Turkish consuls took place.  The greater problem came with  the Turkish Jews who had abandoned their  Turkish citizenship  and had  become French  citizens. The consuls couldn't declare that  these people were Turkish citizens because  they were  not.  My book  includes  photographs of  Jews lining  up in  front  of  the Turkish  consulate,  either to  get passports to  return to Turkey or  to get a restoration  of their Turkish  citizenship.   This  was   a  bureaucratic   matter,  so processing the application would take  some time. In the meantime it was a  real emergency, because the Nazis would  arrest Jews on the streets for almost nothing.  The Nazis would even arrest them if they  had radios  or telephones  in their  apartments, because radios and  telephones were  forbidden to Jews.  To take  care of these  former  Turkish Jews,  the  Turkish  diplomats invented  a document called  gayri muntazem  vatandash, or  "irregular fellow citizen." The  document said in  effect "This person is  a former Turkish  citizen  who has  applied  for  the restoration  of  his Turkish citizenship.  In the meantime  we would appreciate  it if you  would treat  him  as  if he  were  a  Turkish citizen."  The diplomats wrote  the document in  Turkish and put their  seals on it. Since  the Nazis could  not read  Turkish, on the  whole they accepted  these papers  as certificates  of citizenship.  By this means, the  Turkish diplomats were  able to rescue many  Jews who had relinquished their Turkish citizenship.  Actually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense of Jews. On the one hand the  Nazi Foreign Ministry, which wanted to retain the friendship of Turkey,  was in favor of accepting these interventions. On the other hand, Himmler and Eichmann wanted all Jews exterminated.  At times  Himmler and  Eichmann were  able to prevail and some  of the Turkish Jews were sent  off to Auschwitz before the Turkish consuls could do anything.  - Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued?  There were about  20,000 Turkish Jews in Europe  before world War II,  about 10,000  of whom  were living  in France.  Most of  the information in this section of  the book relates to the situation in France. I have published  the letters that the Turkish consuls sent to  the Nazi  officials and  the letters  that came  back in reply. Generally the Nazis said  that if the Turkish consul would present  documents  certifying   that  arrested  individuals  are Turkish citizens,  and promise  to send them  out of  France, the Nazis would release them from the concentration camp. The Turkish consuls also organized  special trains to take  Turkish Jews from Nazi-occupied  territory   back  to  Turkey.  These   trains  ran regularly in 1943 and 1944. The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visas so they  could pass out  of Nazi  territory, but the  trains were often  held  up by  the  Nazi-influenced  governments of  Eastern Europe  -   Croatia,  Serbia,   and  Bulgaria  -   because  these governments really didn't want the Jews to escape. As a result of the Turkish consuls' efforts, about 3,000 to 4,000 of the Turkish Jews  in  France were  saved.  Another  3,000  were sent  off  to Auschwitz, where  most of them  died. The remaining  3,000 either escaped  across the  border into  Spain or  fled to  the area  of southern France occupied  by the Italians, who  treated Jews much better than  the Nazis did.  At the  end of 1943,  however, Italy fell out of the war, and that was the end for those Jews as well. Incidentally, the Turkish diplomats  in Nazi-occupied Greece also worked to rescue Jews in that country.  - The second part of your  book then deals with Turkish diplomats acting to  rescue Jews of  Turkish citizenship or  Turkish origin from Nazi persecution.  Yes,  and  there  is  an  aside   I  might  add  here:  In  their interventions on  behalf of Turkish  Jews, the Turks  cited their treaty with Germany which stated  that Turkish citizens in German territory would be treated the same as German citizens in Turkey. On  that basis  the Turks  maintained  that the  Nazis could  not discriminate  against Turkish  citizens who  are Jews.  The Nazis claimed  (and the  Vichy government  agreed) that  they were  not discriminating  because  they  were treating  all  Jews  equally. Turkey  protested,   saying,  "You  are  dividing   our  citizens according to religion, but the Turkish constitution requires that all  citizens   be  treated  equally,  regardless   of  religion. Therefore, you cannot single  out Turkish Jews." American consuls in  Paris,  by contrast,  accepted  the  Nazi argument  and  told American Jews  who were being  persecuted by the Nazis  that they couldn't do  anything about  it, because  the American  Jews were being treated the same as other  Jews. The third part of the book takes place in Turkey, which  was the principal center during the Holocaust for activities aimed at  the rescue of Eastern European Jews. The  kwish Agency, an  organization established by  Jews in Palestine to help resettle Jews to Palestine, set up an office in Istanbul  in 1940  under the  leadership of  Chaim Barlas.  Other Jewish organizations in Palestine, especially the kibbutzes, also sent representatives  to Istanbul  to set up  headquarters. These groups first tried to contact Jews  in Eastern Europe to find out what was  happening. Today  we know about  the Holocaust,  but at that  time people  didn't know  what  was going  on. They  didn't imagine the Nazis could do the things they were doing. And so the first step was to get information, and the Turkish government let them use the Turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and friends  in Eastern  Europe. The  Jewish organizations  found out what was happening when they  received replies. Later on when the Nazis  began  to  intercept   such  letters,  the  Jews  received assistance  also from  the  Vatican nuncio,  Angelo Roncali,  who served as  the Vatican  representative in  Istanbul from  1935 to 1944  and   later  became  Pope   John  XXIII.  As   the  Vatican representative  during the  war, he  used the  facilities of  the Catholic  Church to  supplement what  the Turkish  government was doing to  assist Jewish  agencies in  contacting Jews  in Eastern Europe.  With the  cooperation of  the Turkish  government, these agencies  then  sent  hard  currency, food,  clothing,  and  even railroad  and  steamship  tickets   to  Jews  in  Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. They weren't able to help much in Poland because  by then the  Nazis had  wiped out almost  all the Polish Jews.  Whenever possible the rescue  agencies arranged for the Jews to get out of Eastern Europe either by train through the so called  Orient Express route  to Istanbul, or by  boat through the Black Sea to Istanbul.  Turkey was not eager for all  these refugees to remain within its borders during  the war, because  it was being blockaded  and was suffering   terrible  shortages   of  food   and  clothing.   The government,   therefore,   facilitated   the  movement   of   the non-Turkish Jewish  refugees from Turkey to  Palestine, either by the Taurus  Express Railroad through  the mountains to  Syria and Palestine,  or by  small boats  across the  eastern Mediterranean from southern  Turkey to  Palestine. These efforts  were bitterly opposed not only  by the Nazis, but also by  the British, who did not want  any more Jewish  immigration to Palestine  because they feared it would hurt their  relations with the Arabs. The British constantly pressured the Turkish  government to stop this traffic and send those Jews back. In  a few cases the Turkish government, yielding  to  British pressure,  did  send  the boats  back.  For example, in  one incident,  the steamship  Struma, with  some 700 Jewish  refugees  from Romania,  was  sent  back by  the  Turkish government  as  a  result  of the  intervention  of  the  British ambassador. When  that ship was  sunk by a Soviet  submarine, all were lost except one person.  Nevertheless, all told, the Turkish government allowed no fewer than 100,000 Eastern European Jews to pass through  Turkish territory and  move on to  Palestine during the Second World War. The Turkish authorities also provided these refugees with facilities  and money, and gave  them permission to send money and food out of the country.  - Many  of these  Jews who  passed  through Turkey  may still  be living in Israel.  Yes, and  their children. But  let's return  for a moment  to the first group, the Turkish Jews who  came from Europe. They did not go  on  to   Palestine;  they  stayed  in  Turkey.   It  was  the non-Turkish, Eastern  European Jews who passed  through Turkey en route to Palestine. Their story is very interesting.  - And you have rescued it from obscurity.  Many studies have been made of the Holocaust, but most of them do not focus on the Eastern European or Middle Eastern Jews. Most of the scholarship  has centered  on the  Western European  Jews, of whom 6 million were massacred by the Nazis. My study deals with a much smaller  number of  people. I  have tried  to round  out the picture,  and I  hope my  book  will persuade  other scholars  to undertake further investigations in the history of Eastern Jews.  When it  comes to numbers,  the German Jews were  also relatively small in number. Most of the millions slain were Polish Jews. The rescue  of  100,000  Eastern  European   Jews  may  not  seem  so significant  compared  with  the  total of  6  million  who  were murdered, but it meant a lot to those who were saved.  About  three-fourths   of  the  book  consists   of  documents  - translations  of many  documents. They  are included  because the story is not well known. Not  only are people in the West unaware of  the courageous  actions of  the Turkish  diplomats; even  the people of Turkey  did not know the story. I  felt that they would not  fully understand  this  remarkable  achievement unless  they could see the documents.  - What languages are used in the documents?  Most of them are in Turkish  or French; some are in Hebrew. There is a great  deal of material in Hebrew about  the organization of the boats  going to Palestine, the  passengers, and so on,  but I did not go into those details extensively. I describe mostly what Turkey did, so  most of my documents are in  Turkish or French. A few documents are  in English. The Jewish groups  in Istanbul did not necessarily  cooperate with  one another  to rescue  Jews; in fact, they often fought with  one another. They took turns trying to  get  the  Turkish  government to  deport  rival  groups.  For example, some of  the kibbutz groups felt that  the Jewish Agency was  run by  Western European  Jews who  were interested  only in helping  Western  European  Jews.  Finally,  in  1944,  President Roosevelt sent a personal  representative, Ira Hirschman, who had been an executive of Bloomingdale's  department store in New York City, and  Hirschman managed to reconcile  their differences. The documents related to his mission are in English.  I also obtained many documents  from Serge Klarsfeld, a Holocaust historian in France,  who mainly worked on the  French Jews. (His father was  killed by  the Nazis.)  He gave  me materials  he had gathered in the German archives on  the Turkish Jews, so I didn't personally consult the German archives.  I believe that much more can  be learned  from the  German  archives, and  I hope  someone someday will make the effort.  - This new book fits in well with your teaching, doesn't it?  Right. I'm  giving a  course on  the history of  the Jews  of the Ottoman  Empire.  I first  gave  the  course  two years  ago.  In addition to  research, writing, and teaching,  I've been actively involved in  the commemoration  of the  500th anniversary  of the coming of the  Jews to the Ottoman Empire. Among  other things, I helped organize  a large international conference  on the subject which was held in Istanbul in 1992.  - Now that your  books are finished and the  conference has taken place, what do you plan to do next?  I'm working on two new books. One is a history of the Turkish War for Independence, which took place  after World War I, during the years  1918 to  1923. The  Turks warded  off the  efforts of  the victorious  European   powers  to  occupy  Turkey   and  end  its independence. The  second book is  a study of Sultan  Abdul Hamid II, the last major sultan, who ruled from 1876 to 1909. He was an important modernizer in his own  way, although he also suppressed all sorts of political movements.  Stanford  J. Shaw  received  a B.A.  in History  and  an M.A.  in British History. He then shifted to Near Eastern History, earning a second M.A.  and a Ph.D. at Princeton. As  a doctoral candidate at Princeton, he  spent two years abroad, studying  at the School of  Oriental  and  African  Studies, University  of  London;  the University of  Cairo, the American  University at Cairo,  and the University of  Istanbul. He  taught at  Harvard before  coming to UCLA in 1966. His postdoctoral research has been supported by the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the American Research Institute in  Turkey, the  Social  Science Research  Council, the  National Endowment for the Humanities, the Fulbright Program, and ISOP. He has  received  honorary  degrees   from  Harvard  University  and Bosporus University, Bebek, Istanbul, Turkey, and medals of honor for lifetime contributions  to the fields of  Islamic and Turkish studies from the Center for Research in Islamic History, Art, and Culture in  Istanbul and from  the American Friends of  Turkey in Washington,  D.C. In  addition to  undertaking many  professional service activities and public lectures  in both the United States and Turkey,  Shaw has  also produced eight  books and  one edited volume. His  History of  the Ottoman Empire  and Modem  Turkey (2 vols.)  has been  published  in many  editions  (six editions  or reprints  from 1977-1991),  and  translated  into Turkish  (1983, 1991) and French (1984). His book  The Jews of the Ottoman Empire and  the  Turkish  Republic  (MacMillan,  London,  and  New  York University Press, 1992) will  be published in Turkish translation by the Turkish  Historical Society, Istanbul. His  Turkey and the Holocaust: Turkey's  Role in Rescuing Turkish  and European Jewry from Nazi  Persecution, 1933-1945 will be  published by Macmillan Publishers,  London, and  New York  University Press  in 1993.  A pamphlet summarizing the book was published in Ankara, Turkey, in 1992.  Serdar Argic                             'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                              might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                              and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'                                                   (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)                            'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists                              a single Turkish soul.' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)

Good statement! Should we apply empirical measurements to define exact social morals? Should morals be based on social rules? On ancient religious doctrines? It seems there will *NEVER* be a common and single denominator for defining morals, and as such defining absolute and objective morals is doomed to fail as long as humans have  this incredible talent of creative thinking.

For a start there are enough current versions of the Bible to make comparisons to show that what you write above is utter garbage. Witness JW, Mormon, Catholic, Anglican, and Greek Orthodox Bibles. But to really convince you I'd have to take you to a good old library. In our local library we had a 1804 King James which I compared to a brand new, hot of God's tongue Good News Bible. Genesis was almost unrecognisable, many of the discrepencies between the four gospels had been edited from the Good News Bible. In fact the God of Good News was a much more congenial fellow I must say.   If you like I'll get the 1804 King James out again and actually give you some quotes. At least the headings haven't changed much.  Jeff.

When will people learn!  The trouble is the ballast in the concrete and as every fool knows Ballast  resistors are used to discharge batteries. Furthermore it is very silly to  store the battery with the terminals downwards as you must have done to  contact the ballast.   Seriously: self discharge (the actual problem, as stated by others) does vary  greatly with certain types and freaks show low self discharge. I have in  fact seen ordinary automotive batteries which have effectively held full  charge for > 2 years so it must be possible.  If your garage is heated, store the batteries somewhere cooler but above  freezing (flat batteries freeze more easily). Occasionally charge it (once a  month?) or even leave it on 'float' charge permanently (special charger,  DON'T do this unless you know what you are doing, seriously dangerous).  Anouther point is the unsuitability of automotive batteries for things like  electric mowers -- they are not generally designed to be repeatedly deep  discharged and their life may be greatly shorted. Some early zero maintenance  automotive batteries in fact responded to a full discharge with total failure  shortly afterwards but modern ones are superb.

I have not had much chance to fiddle with it, but in comparison to our Laserwriters with Canon engines, she complains that the print is too light for her taste.  The difference is quite apparent even when the print setting on the Select 310 is adjusted to the darkest possible level.  I don't find it objectionable, and indeed rather like it, but be warned that some people don't care for it and it is considerably different.   I recall that years ago there were lots of debates over write-black vs. write-white engines when dealing with TeX drivers.  Is something like that going on here?

If you are paying for a phone, and you don't want call-waiting, YOU DON'T NEED TO PAY FOR CALl-WAITING.  This whole Clinton induced abortion debate SHOULD begin to make NARAL nervous, because it has exposed a real scam.  If one is paying for a PRIVATE health insurance plan and DOES NOT WANT "abortion coverage" there is NO reason for that person to be COMPLELLED to pay for it.  (Just as one should not be compelled to pay for lipposuction coverage if ONE doesn't WANT that kind of coverage).  A full third of the country flatly considers abortion to be murder for reasons of conscience.  If the first amendment means ANYTHING at all anymore, then these people should NOT be COMPELLED to PAY for "abortion coverage" if it is so OBVIOUSLY offensive to their beliefs.  Or are we going to start forcing Jews to eat pork, Quakers to fight in wars, etc?  No one should be COMPELLED to sign a defacto "loyalty oath" in support of abortion in order to gain access to health care, ESPECIALLY if one's conscience is so obviously against the practice (of abortion).  dennis dzkriz@ocf.berkeley.edu  PS Sure read through the two short form letters I posted at the beginning of this post.

One study found that at some places at least, 1/6 of the women professed to be "Born Again".

I'm asking $200.00 a piece, and list on them when I bought them was     $375.00.  If you're interested in both of them, I'd be willing to come     down on the price a little bit.   (1) Precision Power 2150.  This great utility amplifier is rated at 2x150,     and looks brand new.  The shroud is unscratched, and it works great.     This is a great low-end amp because of it's high-power rating into     2 channels, however, I've also had it running front or back high end     before where it did very well.

The first company that comes along with a Windows based package that:     manages budgets and accounts     manages loans     calculates taxes     uses all of the above and knowledge about my investing philosophy to       help me invest in the right investment vehicles, and     integrates it all together  will have my business for life.

The Orthodox have said that >they accept all that it says, with the exception of the filioque, but >it is not "in use."  Which is exactly what I pointed out.  (Though I was wrong about your use of the Creed, the 1913 Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about it said the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the filioque.  Apparently that has changed.)  The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque, the Nicene - Constantinopolitan did not. 	Of course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene Creed (it wasn't there to begin with), but they certainly did from the Athanasian Creed, which did have it from the beginning. 	I might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in ways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity, the East emphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father through the Son, and the West using proceeding from the Father and the Son.  In fact, some, such as Tertullian, used both formulations (see below)  	"Following, therefore, the form of these examples, I profess that I do call God and His Word, - the Father and and His Son, - two.  For the root and the stem are two things, but conjoined; the fountain and the river are two kinds, but indivisible; the sun and the ray are two forms, but coherent ones.  Anything which proceeds from another must necessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds; but it is not on that account separated from it.  Where there is second, however, there are two; and where ther is third, there are three.  The Spirit, then, is third from God and the Son, just as the third from the root is the fruit of the stem, and third from the fountain is the stream from the river, and thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray." 	-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 8, 5 (about 213 AD)  and  	"I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Father through the Son" 	-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 4, 1 (about 213 AD)  And as St. Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part 1, Question 36, Articles 2 and 3, there is no contradiction between the two methods of generation, and in fact, the two methods of reckoning the procession emphasize what St. Augustine, among others taught, that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, but He proceeds from the Father in a more preeminent way.  	"For whatever the Son has, He has from the Father, certainly He has it from the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him ... For the Father alone is not from another, for which reason He alone is called unbegotten, not, indeed, in the Scriptures, but in the practice of theologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a matter so great.  The Son, however, is born of the Father; and the Holy Spirit proceeds principally from the Father, and since the Father gives to the Son all that He has without any interval of time, the Holy Spirit proceeds jointly from both Father and Son.  He would be called Son of the Father and of the Son if, which is abhorent to everyone of sound mind, they had both begotten Him.  The Spirit was not begotten by each, however, but proceeds from each and both." 	-St. Augustine of Hippo, The Trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 AD)  So, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the West at least), because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, but in proceeding from the Son, the orgin of that procession is the procession from the Father, so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the Father through the Son, but as all that the Son has is from the Father, the Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father, without any mention of the Son being necessary. 	In any case, I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope St. Leo I, St. Fulgence of Ruspe, St. Cyril of Alexandria, Pope St. Damsus I, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, St. Ambrose of Milan, St. Hilary of Poitiers, Tertullian, and others among the Fathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic position, which I enunciated above. 	As for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden, I will point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke of the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone "to produce, write, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by the Fathers of Nicea."  That Creed is a different Creed than that of Constantinople, which is commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not of course in that they were condemning the adoption of the Constantinopolitan Creed, which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of Nicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious, who had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the Church, which among other things denied the procession of the Holy Spirit form the Son.  Thus, the additions of the Constantinopolitan Creed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the Council Chalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Son, which Nestorius denied, they could hardly have been against explaining in a fuller way the Creed, for they themselves approved of previous additions to it.  And if the further explanations of the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work done by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical, it follows that the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed by the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians in Spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until many years later under Photius and others.  And that the filioque was not disputed, I provide more quotes below.  	"Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to God, and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son, it is abundantly clear that He is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceeding from it." 	-St. Cyril of Alexandria, The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial Trinity, Thesis 34, (423-425 AD)  	"The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but he is the Spirit of the Father and the Son.  For it is written: `If anyone loves the world, the Spirit of the Father is not in him'; and again it is written: `If anyone, however, does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.'  When the Father and the Son are named in this way, the Holy Spirit is understood, of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel, that the Holy Spirit `proceeds from the Father,' and that `He shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you.'" 	-Pope St. Damasus I, The Decree of Damasus, 1 (382 AD)  	"The only-begotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor the appelation of Father, but is called Holy Spirit, and is not foreign to the Father.  For the Only-begotten Himself calls Him: `the Spirit of the Father,' and says of Him the `He proceeds from the Father,' and `will receive of mine,' so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to the Son, but is of their same substance, of the same Godhead; He is Spirit divine, ... of God, and He is God.  For he is Spirit of God, Spirit of the Father, and Spirit of the Son, not by some kind of synthesis, like soul and body in us, but in the midst of Father and Son of the Father and of the Son, a third by appelation.... 	"The Father always existed and the Son always existed, and the Spirit breathes from the Father and the Son; and neither is the Son created nor is the Spirit created." 	-St. Epiphanius of Salamis (which is on Cyprus), The Man Well-Anchored, 8 and 75 (374 AD)  	"Concerning the Holy Spirit, I ought not to remain silent, nor yet is it necessary to speak.  Still, on account of those who do not know Him, it is not possible for me to be silent.  However it is necessary to speak of Him who must be acknowledged, who is from the Father and the Son, His Sources." 	-St. Hilary of Poitiers, The Trintiy, 2, 29 (356 to 359 AD)  	Thus, as I have pointed out before, Gaul, Spain, Italy, Africa, Egypt, Palastine, and the lands of the Greeks, all of Christnedom at that time, all have Fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine expressed by the filioque.  I suggest to those of the Orthodox Church that they come up with some of the Fathers, besides St. John of Damascus who all will admit denied the filioque, to support their views.  It is not enough to bring up the "proceeds from the Father" line of the Creed or the Gospel of John, for that says what we believe also.  But it does not say the Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Son, only that He does proceed from the Father.  Andy Byler

Visualists from all technical levels 	are welcome.    	REVOLT will be structured simply.  There will be  	three stages of production.  The first stage will 	consist of all participants creating one still  	work as a "starter" piece that two other partici- 	pants will, in turn, manipulate.  All first stage 	"base" images are due by Sunday, May 23rd, 1993,  	midnight Central Daylight Time.   	Stage two will begin on May 24th.  All images will  	be sent to another (arbitrarily chosen) participant 	for them to do manipulations on in anyway they see  	fit.  For purely digital artists, this may consist 	of filtering the image through their favorite paint 	program.  For "analog" artists, this may well be 	printing a hardcopy of the image and adding their 	own part with pen, pencil or white-out then scan- 	ning in the image again to be transferred on to  	the third-stage artist.  All second-stage works 	are due by midnight on Sunday, May 30th.  	Stage three is the finishing stage and will begin 	on May 31st.  All artists will do what they think  	it takes to finish up the image they've been given 	using whatever technique they see as worthy.   	These images will be due on June 6th, midnight.

There are, but not any that would help Texans: In many states, such laws have been found to violate the state constitution.  But the federal Second Amendment does not apply directly to the states. It was written to limit the federal government only.  The Fourteenth Amendment was written to extend the restrictions of the Bill of Rights to the state level. However, the exact wording of the Fourteenth Amendment is very vague. The Supreme Court has been dancing around the issue without facing it directly for over 100 years. In practice, the Bill of Right (indirectly applies through the Fourteenth) applies to the state governments only if the Supreme Court has ruled that  particular provision. The Court has made no such rulings on the Second Amendment.                                                   Frank Crary                                                  CU Boulder

(Others could not help but exercise comic relief, but given the tension, I think this reaction is understandable.) My rasberry award goes to Dave Palmer who makes the following benediction after spewing out the facts,  	"Score another one for the forces of ignorance and superstition"  as if the public deaths of over 80 people were not a clear and definite  warning as to what happens to people who follow false prophets.  	From where I set, looks like Satan has a three-bagger going.

One thing that should be made clear is that neither the FBI nor the BATF is responsible for what happened yesterday. One can argue about the initial raid, but it would be worth mentioning, before the facts get lost, that  	1. The Branch Davidians were tipped off that the BATF was coming 	during the initial raid.  	2. The Branch Davidians opened fire first.  	It is also worth noting that the Branch Davidians, according to the FBI's statements, opened fire immediately when the FBI issued the warning over the phone, and that the vehicle which launched the tear gas grenades did so under fire from the compound.  > >>  >> The killing of the four BATF agents was surey a dispicable act, but that was >> an escalation of the confrontation which the BATF started.

The articles goes on to say how "sources" close to the >Justice Department claim that some agents were caught in "heavy crossfire."  	Clearly, no one in the government wanted a repeat of the initial  shootout, That's why they went in with riot control gas. This would have worked with minimal casualties (The Branch Davidians apparently did not have gas masks) if Koresh had not had a very different reaction in mind.  > > >> precisely because of humanity's tendancy for escalation.

The question is whether yesterday's raid was wired tightly enough. Reno and Sessions both made statements to the press indicating that the experts had not indicated that such a reaction was (possible ?) (likely ?). They both indicated that they had no idea that a Masada-like mass suicide could result from the introduction of non-lethal agents into the compound.  	Some of these issues are highly technical - the impression I have is that the "Ranch Apocalypse" represented a Rubrik's cube for the counterterrorist types. The Branch Davidians were too well armed for  for a simple assault (the BATF found this out the hard way). The complex was probably to big for the kind of "surgical" Delta Force coup de main that the Bundesgrenschutz did in the 1970s when one of their airliners was highjacked by "Black September". The reason this seige had gone on as long as it had was that the government really didn't have any good options, and to wait it out was the safest and most logical choice.  > >Similarly, why the raid yesterday?  Reno has a bunch of different >answers she's shopping around, none f which make much senOn >Nightline tonight, she tried the "we were concerned about child abuse" >card, and then it was pointed out that the info. on the child abuse >was over two weeks old.  Then she switched to the "It couldn't go >on any longer"-style stuff until that kind of played out.  	My own theory is that something was supposed to have happened on Easter. Koresh had made some statements building that idea up, and  Easter came and went with nothing happening. It may be that the authorities felt emboldened to move for this reason. IT IS just a theory.  > >Why yesterday?  Because this was turning into a huge embarassment for >the Clinton administration.  	I don't believe this is a valid argument. Obviously, hindsight is 20/20, but the risks of doing anything to provoke the Davidians were clear enough to warrant caution and to delay action.  > >> > It was interesting to watch the 700 club today.

I imagine there are a good many people who are having some problems processing the reality of this affair now.   	1. This matter ties in with the infamous "social scientists are not 	really scientists" brouhaha on sci.skeptic. Here is a case where, if 	one believes the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI, the 	predictions of psychological experts were proven false, not under 	laboratory conditions, but in the cauldron of practical application.  	2. Koresh's actions (or the actions of whoever started the fire -  	we're not likely to know what went on in there) contrast so violently 	with the example of Christ that I'm sure many Christians find it 	difficult to understand why or how this happened. Under such  	conditions, the search for scapegoats is only too natural a human 	reaction, even though that is not a particularly Christian response 	either.  	3. Koresh's mother apparently had some false hopes that the cult  	members had sought refuge in a bunker somewhere in the complex. Her  	grief must be monumental at this time, and the search for a way to 	escape moral responsibility for her family's destruction is likewise 	real. We may not have seen the end to the self depravation.  	4. The fact, simply stated, is that a good number of innocent children 	and not-so-innocent adults died horribly for no good reason. It is 	exceptionally hard for us, as human beings, to accept this fact. 	We can hope for some ultimate salvation, some panacea to make it 	better, but even though hope is a wonderful thing, that doesn't 	make it so. There is no meaning to this thing. It just is.     Bill R.  --  "When up a dangerous faction starts,         "My opinions do not represent With wrath and vengeance in their hearts;     those of my employer or By solemn League and Cov'nant bound,          any government agency." To ruin, slaughter, and confound;             - Bill Riggs (1993) To turn religion to a fable, And turn the Government to a Babel; Pervert the law, disgrace the gown, Corrupt the senate, rob the crown; To sacrifice old England's glory, And make her infamous in story.

The bears are a national treasure, the area is their sanctuary and people who enter it do so at their own risk.  It is better that that rare human be killed by a bear than that bears be provoked or shot by unbear-savvy visitors.  The bears aren't having a population explosion, humans are so it is better that a human be killed than endanger the bears. I don't agree with this philosopy, but I understand it.  	The psychos are a bit different.  They are not a national treasure but I suppose the decision has been made that to "allow" provision for defense against them would also "allow" provision for defense against bears.  Again, I suppose it has been decided that it is better for the rare human to be killed by a psycho than to take a chance on threatening the bears.  	Personally, I wouldn't go into an area where I would be "managed" so as to reduce my safety ..... but ... come to think of it I guess I live in a managed wilderness myself :-)  Joan V

He's setting himself up to be in hot water.  Indeed.  Reading the cases of people who've tried the various things Mr. Teel suggests show that defendants fall into two classes: (1) those who win on procedural grounds or some grounds not related to their claim, and (2) those who lose.  Consider Newman v. Schiff, 778 F.2d 460 (8th Cir.1985), which I've seen cited by tax protestors other than Mr. Teel as a win for Mr. Schiff. Mr. Schiff offered $100,000 on TV to anyone who would call in the show and cite any section of the Internal Revenue Code that says that an individual has to file a return.  Mr. Newman took him up on it.  Mr. Newman had seen the show in a rebroadcast the next morning.  Mr. Schiff claimed that the offer only extended to people who actually say the original broadcast, and so there was no offer for Mr. Newman to accept, and so no unilateral contract was formed, and so Mr. Schiff did not have to pay $100,000.  Mr. Schiff was correct, and so won.  So, yes, Mr. Schiff won against a claim on the $100,000 reward.  However, his win had nothing to do with the tax code.  --Tim Smith

It isn't so much a matter of 'interpretation' of Bible texts  that sets Mormonism apart from orthodoxy as it is a matter of  *fabrication*.  	About 20 years ago, _National Lampoon_ had some comic strips  in them that were drawn by Neal Adams. They were called "Son o' God" comics.  It was a parody of the Jesus in the Bible. In the comic, there were a  group of thirteen Jewish kids from Brooklyn, and when one of them said  the magic word, he turned into "Son o' God." He went from a myopic,  curly headed, yarmulke wearing boy to a replica of the stylizied  portraits of Jesus --- with long flowing brown hair and gentile  features.	  	Now, if someone were to profess faith in this NatLamp Jesus,  and claim that they were a Christian because they believed in this  NatLamp Jesus, we would have to say that this was fallacious since  this Jesus was a fabrication, and did not really exist.  	This is the exact same thing that the LDS do when they claim  that they are Christian. They profess faith in Jesus, but the Jesus  that they profess to have faith in is as much a fabrication as the  NatLamp Jesus was.   ============================= Robert Weiss psyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu

(Sorry, I didn't say the solution was free.) In the past I'd tried everything with my Microsoft serial mouse. (Cleaning it, unloading all kinds of TSRs, turning off SMARTDRV write cacheing, changing COM ports, ...) Nothing worked. Yesterday I finally broke down and bought a Mouse Systems Bus Mouse. The improvement is even better than I had imagined! So much so that my old mouse must have been jumpy all the time (I just thought it was jumpy sometimes), and I had gotten so used to it I didn't notice. My wife, who uses the computer about once a month, noticed the improvement literally within a second!  I can't say anything about other bus mice, but with the Mouse Systems one you'll have to give up either COM2 or LPT2 to an IRQ. Also, if you don't know, Mouse Systems mice have three buttons. The driver includes a utility that lets you assign keystrokes to the middle button.  Hope this helps someone else. If you're anywhere near as frustrated as I was, it's well worth the $80.  ---  Stephen Thomas   AT&T Tridom   (404-514-3522) email: sat@eng.tridom.com, attmail!tridom!sat

Brock, Coleman, and Wilson were hot-dog basestealers (also Lonnie Smith); that seems to be a special class.  CFs like Pettis and Wilson also get  more of a break, especially if they actually *do* field well.  And Brock wasn't all that bad a hitter either, not until the end there when he  spoiled his ifetime .300 BA.  And again, I suspect thatthe problem is lessening over time.

Are you saying they thought the effort was profitable or that the money was efficiently spent (providing max value per money spent)?  I think they would answer yes on ballance to both questions. Exceptions would be places like the US from the French Indian War to the end of the US Revolution.   But even after the colonies revolted or where given independance the British engaged in very lucrative trading with the former colonies. Five years after the American Revolution England was still the largest US trading partner.

And I don't think ANY guilty verdicts should have been returned. I'm sure you know why they handed down guilty verdicts on two of the officers. It's quite simple really, it was a compromise to avoid rioting in the places where minorities think it's right to riot. I hate to say this, but I would have liked to see them riot with everyone prepared. It would be open season if your skin was even slightly brown.

Apple has really confused people with this whole thing. I think we'll be answering this question for about the next year or so. There is no "option" to get an FPU on a C650. What you have is a choice of CPUs: there is the 68LC040 that does not have an integrated FPU like the full '040 and is only present in the base 4/80 model of the C650 (AppleUSA). And there is the full '040 which you get when you order anything other than the base 4/80 configuration. Therefore, since you have ordered one of the 8MB versions with on-board Ethernet models you will not be getting the LC040. But even if you wanted to have the LC040 you wouldn't be able to order a C650 with 8MB RAM, on-board Ethernet and an LC040. It's not an "option."     Also, a note to people out there that have 4/80 C650s and C610s thinking that there is an optional FPU, the '040 class chip cannot recognize an external FPU, so there is no socket on the motherboard for a FPU chip and you cannot go out and purchase an FPU on a PDS card or something like that. The only way to get an FPU in these machines is to replace the LC040 with a full '040. And if you have a C610, you will not need to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the LC040 with the full '040, but if you have a 4/80 C650 you do need to have a heat sink.  -Hades

If you multiplexed the EMG inputs at 10KHz, that would probably be sufficient for most physiology studies (you'd have ~ 330 Hz per channel sampling rate.)  That level of analog multiplexing should be rather easy to accomplish.  Combining a lot of RF carriers is pretty tricky to do without generating intermodulation.  A system to be carried by a runner is in a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult to keep balanced.  A commercial hand-held transciever could probably be employed with a little modification to accomodate widening the bandwidth.

I think that HCI people honestly believe that passing more gun control laws will be in the best interests of public safety.  Why do I think this?  Because I used to buy the HCI line.  During my freshman year (1987), their line made so much sense -- only people who "need" guns should be able to get them, and the people who "need" them are the police and other elites.  Unfortunately for us, this position is highly emotional and not well thought-out.  They never stop to think that HCI's position basically says that the non-elite are incompetents (that's you and me, folks!) and that the Second Amendment has absolutely nothing to do with hunting or other "legitimate" uses (which excludes overthrowing tyrannical governments and defending yourself when the police have proven they can't protect you).  >	We all know that the end result, regardless of the intention, >will be to have a MUCH easier to subdue population for the UN/NWO. >This is definitely a motivation of many in power, but I wonder to >what degree this is planned vs just duped.  Every pro-control person I've talked to is always left  stumped when I simply argue the facts of gun control (that it has yet to be proven to lower crime rates) and weapons terminology (and I'm no expert -- but explaining exactly how an "evil" semiautomatic weapon really works does wonders).  I hvae personally found well-reasoned arguments to be most effective against the emotional pro-control people.  The trick is to get them to realize that the Second Amendment exists not for hunters but for the oppressed and the terrorized.

From all indications, it wasn't the "major" factor, but the "last straw". There were personality conflicts among Shark management, and disagreements over how personnel were going to be handled (not just who was being traded vs. kept, but who was being sent to KC. What Ferriera did, if rumors are right, was not always what the folks behind the bench wanted or needed).  >I'm inclined to take exactly the opposite view:  they should have kept >him...he's obviously the luckiest man in hockey!  I think if they'd kept Ferriera, they would have lost some of their other management staff. Depending on which sources you trust, we might have lost Grillo AND Lombardi AND Murdoch over the summer. Frankly, I want to keep those three. (we may well ahve also lost Kingston, which, of course, is now a moot point).   The Sharks have been building an organizational staff that is highly consensual and cooperative. Ferriera wanted to run things his way. There were conflicts. Ferriera lost. That says nothing about his skills or accomplishments -- at that level, a lot is personality and politics.   I think he did some good things for the Sharks, but that he never fit in as a "Shark person". I hope he succeeds beyond his wildest dreams down in Anaheim, too, because it'll be good for hockey.

Keep the deal with the dealer simple by eliminating 2 & 3.  Buying a car at  "dealer's cost" is meaningless if he makes $1000 on the trade and/or gets a  kickback from the bank.  Blue book (you need to know if you're talking average wholesale or average  retail) is a good guide to value for a car.  If you are selling it yourself,  try to get average retail, and chances are you'll have done ok.  Be careful selling to acquaintances if you ever want them to become friends.  c. b. fowler  gtri/esml chris.fowler@gtri.gatech.edu

She suffered from asthma at that age and she and her family were living in an abandoned prison cell of some sort.  She had to ask the 'Lady' several times in her apparitions about  what her name was since her confessor priest asked her to do so.   For several instances, the priest did not get an answer since  Bernadette did not receive any.  One time, after several apparitions passed, The Lady finally said, "I am the Immaculate Conception". So, Bernadette, was so happy and repeated these words over and over in her mind so as not to forget it before she told the priest who was asking.  So, when she told the priest, the priest was shocked and asked Bernadette, "Do you know what you are talking about?".  Bernadette did not know what exactly it meant but she was just too happy to have the answer for the priest.  The priest continued with, "How did you remember this if you do not know?".  Bernadette answered honestly that she had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her way to the priest...  The priest knew about the dogma being four years old then. But Bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer which the priest finally observed and took as proof of an authentic personal revelation of Our Lady to Bernadette.  (Note: This Lady of Lourdes shrine has a spring of water which our lady requested Bernadette to dig up herself with her bare hands in front of pilgrims.  At the start little water flowed but after several years there is more water  flowing.)  -Marida  "...spreading God's words through actions..."  -Mother Teresa

(please, if i am mistinterpreting, correct me.)  however, i have witnessed marriages where two people were very much in love but recognized that they were destroying themselves and each other by staying in a marriage, and that the problems were due to personal childhood issues that had never been resolved.  i ask you, is divorce justified in such a case?  they knew who they were, what they were doing, they were deeply in love, but in the end, it did not work out. i must admit that i don't see jesus forcing them to live together, or even condemning that they go and seek happiness with someone else later on.  opinions?  vera ******************************************************************************* I am your CLOCK!     |  I bind unto myself today    | Vera Noyes I am your religion!  |  the strong name of the	    | noye@midway.uchicago.edu I own you!	     |  Trinity....		    | no disclaimer -- what 	- Lard	     |	- St. Patrick's Breastplate | is there to disclaim? *******************************************************************************  [This is a commonly discussed question, though it's been long enough that I'll allow it to be asked.  As you might expect, there is a range of answers.  Catholics and some others will say that divorce is never justified.  (By the way, in situations where someone is being abused, or for other serious cause, separation is allowed by all traditions that I know.  No one should be forced to stay in a situation where they are in danger.)  Others see it as a last resort in situations that have fallen apart badly enough that the best we can hope for is to choose the lesser of evils.  In some sense the difficult legal question turns out not to be divorce, but remarriage.  That's because of Jesus' statement in Mark 10:11-12 and par.  As with so many other things, this turns on your approach to the Bible.  Conservative Protestants tend to see statements like this as having no exceptions. More liberal ones are willing to make allowances for situations where a literal interpretation would lead to painful results.  (It is noted that at the time it was possible for a man to divorce his wife almost on a whim.  Thus a common explanation in the more liberal approach is that Jesus was trying to protect people from this sort of thing, not to establish an absolute rule to which there could never be exceptions.)  Catholics, as is typical with Catholic ethics, take a theoretical hard line, but allow for exceptions in practice through the process of anullment.  In the last discussion most of our non-Catholic readers seemed to accept with some reluctance that in some cases there might be no good alternative, but there was a feeling that the church should often be doing a better job of helping people prepare for marriage and deal with problems that come up during it, and that in a properly run church, divorce should not be necessary.  --clh]

Spring break, I went through the four corners area and back.  The most beautiful stop I made was in Utah at the Needles Overlook.  Though this is a bit further east than where you appear to be going, I highly recommend it.  IMHO it is far more beautiful than the Grand Canyon.  It was not well marked, but was one of few paved roads off of US191 (I was heading north from Monticello).  In order to get to the right place, I should clarify that it is the Needles OVERLOOK, and not the recreation area.  Heading north from Monticello, it is the second turnoff, and may have been marked as the Anticline Overlook.  Anticline overlook is about 20 (dirt, if this matters to you) miles past the Needles overlook.  The road out to the overlook is paved and reasonably maintained (I ran it about 70mph).  Looking out from the overlook was like being God and looking down on  the world.  If it isn't too far out of your way, you should see it.

There is no doubt that Israeli authorities ordered the destruction of mosques in the vicinity of the Wailing Wall. That does not mean, however, that once can generalize from this to any other points.  The entire plaza, mosques and all, was cleared to make it possible for Jews to have a place to worship in the place that was holiest to many of them, and which had been denied to them for millenia.  On the other hand, throughout the rest of Jerusalem and Israel, to the best of my knowledge, Israeli authorities have scrupulously avoided damage to any Islamic religious sites. This contrasts with the policies of previous regimes which destroyed Jewish synagogues out of hate and bigotry.   --  ________________________________________ Jack F.

How are the relays connected to what you are driving? >  > Need more specifics to answer your question!! :-)  As a general rule, no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer the circuit with the contacts.  The noise you hear is due to the momentary opening and closing of the path.  The noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high impedance audio circuits a resistive "T" is constructed close to characteristic impedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers the audio.  In low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are shorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic impedance.  Sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used to momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.  Telephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to "Make before break and Vica Versa" but I haven't seen any of these for years.  Nowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.  A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive "optical isolator".. It consists of a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is off the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers passing the audio.  Once again this device in a "T" switches the audio.  Varying the lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters and you have a mixer!

I said before the Holocaust. I'm not ignorant of the Holocaust and know more about Nazi Germany than most people (maybe including you).  	What I resent is ignorant statements that call people names when they disagree with your position. Opposing the atrocities commited by the Israeli governement hardly qualifies as anti-semitism. If you think name calling is a valid form of argument in intellectual circles, you need to get out more often. 	I don't think the suffering of some Jews during WWII justifies the crimes commited by the Israeli government. Any attempt to call Civil liberterians like myself anti-semetic is not appreciated.

Just trying to get this clear, so please bear with me.  As far as   I can tell, you're proposing the following rules of engagement   between Israel and the Palestinean resistance.  Please feel   revise this preliminary draft as necessary:    1) Israeli military personnel are fair game at any time, in uniform      or out, on duty or off.  In practice, since any male or female      Israeli of military age (18-?) may be off-duty military, all but      young children are acceptable targets.  Since the existence of      Israel constitutes indication of hostile intent, no further      provocation is required.    2) To avoid inpermissable violations of the rights of non-combatant      Palestineans, Israeli forces must not engage Palestineans      without positive identification as military personnel, clear      indication of aggressive intent, and a clear field of fire.      a) Positive identification may be assured by either checking for        Palestinean military uniform, by posession of exclusively        military armament (ie, T78 MBTs or MiG-29 aircraft), or        self-identification (either verbal or documentary).  Note        that dual-use military/civilian weaponry such as hand grenades,        AK-47 rifles, and RPG launchers do not constitute positive        military identification and require closer inspection such        as document checks.      b) Aggressive intent (as distinct from merely 'hostile' intent,        which is the normal condition) may be assured by not less        than three rounds of incoming fire separated by intervals        of not less than ten seconds between rounds.  Note that a        single burst of automatic-weapon fire counds as one round,        as does a volley of rocket fire from more than one source.        As noted above, dual-use weaponry may NOT be assumed to        originate from military personnel, and thus do not justify        armed response.      c) A clear field of fire can be guaranteed by making a positive        military identification of all personnel in the target area of        the weapons to be used.  Note that aggressive intent need not        be proven for all possible targets.  Thus, if IAF aircraft        are attacked by a SAM crew it is not necessary to check the        papers of each crew member so long as none are obviously        civilians (as indicated, for instance, by the posession of        uniquely civilian weaponry such as stones, axes, and Molotov        coctails.)  Since it is often difficult for IAF elements to        land and make the necessary checks, ground forces should        first screen prospective strike areas before AGM fire.        For ACM purposes, a cockpit-to-cockpit pass within 5 meters        is usually sufficient for this purpose, but may be repeated        if necessary.  --- D. C.

Can we perhaps as the question of whether the Constitution might have been written to appeal to the principles, rather than, as you appear to believe, it was written with something else in mind and "propoganda" put out by its supporters.

We can't know what Phill *really* means because he's obviously using arguments designed to convince.  >|>       Well, I know Hamilton was a dyed in the wool monarchist, and  >|>probably the authoritarian extreme to Jefferson's democratic impules. >|>But what would you suggest as a means of determining their opinions >|>on the government if we don't consider what they wrote about the >|>government? > >I don't propose that any means exists for determining their true opinions. >Thus their true opinions died with them and are of little help today. > >Their opinions have not the slightest bearing on the matter though, only their >arguments. These are true or false regardless of who said them or why.          If they're true or false, regardles of why they were said, why on earth did you make a point of calling them "propogranda?"  That would seem to be irrelevent.  >The >difficulty that most US posters seem to have is in considering that their >arguments may have been flawed or no longer apply to modern societies.          Oh, I have no argument with questioning them.  I don't believe they no longer apply, but that's because I think most of them were good arguments.  I'm not entirely happy about the situation, because they were obviously only applied to a minority of the time, but I don't think that alone is sufficient to invalidate them.  >If they were alive today the one opinion we could count upon these men to >express is that a careful study of the mechanisms of government is necessary >and that an ongoing improvement of the same is required.

Since the U.S. constitution is the basis for the U.S. political system, most changes in it would require Constitutional change.  In this particular case, however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure and tradition.  It only *should* have been made part of the Constitution. :-)  >|>       If the Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords, than >|>we'd almost have to state that the House of Representatives was also. >|>(In fact, they both were, because the British government had much >|>greater power than did the American system).        > >In principle no, in practice yes.

Phill, we're discusing the power of legislative houses.  While the Prime Minister *is* member of Parliament, he is more analgous (although badly) to the U.S. President.          Now, please explain to me how the U.S. House of Representatives is "in principle" more powerful than the House of Lords (or the Senate) but in practice is less.  Are you suggesting that the writers of the Constitution *really* intended for them to be more powerful, but gosh darn the thing was ratified before they realized they'd forgotten to put those extra restrictions on the Senate in?  >|>       I disagree.

These decisions are pushed up to the next higher level >instead.         Not at all.  As any entry level political science course will tell you, people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of government to "attack" which presents them with the best chance of getting what they want.  With national "interest groups" it is simply a very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact a law rather than the states.  Less people to persuade, and less  "contributions" to make.          Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at the Federal level?  Simply because if they win that battle all the little state battlefields are won by extension.  The same extends to insurance, medicine, and most other questions.        Local government has not "failed" in that it hasn't done what it should, but that it is dominated by local interests.  Thus non-local interests who want localities to abide by their rules can't get their rules past the local government.  Thus, since they've got more clout, only in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level because it can impose its will on the lower.        I mean, let's get real here.  Do we *really* need the Congres of the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus- and such pattern?  Or that *carjacking* needs to be a federal as opposed to a local crime?        The more people want the more Congress will take power to "sell" it to them for their votes.  I don't think the rise of "special interests" is coincidence with the increased power of Congress.  >|>       Congress is more than capable of quick action, and has more than >|>enough power and time on its hands, if it confined itself to what its >|>original jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy. > >If they were to start from a social welfare model instead of the current  >"no state subsidy motto" they would be better placed.

The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual need matters, because political power can be concentrated at higher levels, while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to in effectiveness.  >In order to set up a school project in New York state you have to pay off the >other 49 states with pork - defense contracts, agricultural subsidies etc. >Or to be precise 30 of the states since you need 60 to beat the filibuster.         Then why not simply leave New York's education to New York?  I remain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable of educating its own children if that's what they want to do.  And if you leave it to them, you only have to worry about the "pork" in that state.  And since industries can't concentrate their political power and wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and get what they want, individual voices have more relative impact.         The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must "buy off" states, but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork.  >|>       It is not a case of the system of government they created failing, >|>but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically >|>wanted to avoid.

But why on earth should we want to redirect it?  You said yourself  that you have to sell pork to get things through Congress.  If Congres has less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact national legislation within its granted jurisdiction, the pork problem is significantly reduced.  >The current blocks on power simply absolve congress of any responsibility >to come to a decision.          The current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable to action, thus it the system is weighted against action.  Considering the government the usually the institution with the sole power to enforce its decisions by force, I consider bias against making those decisions a good thing.  >Pushing the decisions lower in the pyramid won't >work unless the lower levels are less corrupt. In most cases they are worse, >not better.         The difference with the lower pyramid is that a) they have more legal, legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitution than the federal government, and b) at those lower levels power is harder to concentrate.  And c) you get the benefit of not imposing new deicisons on everybody at once.  You get to see them tried out without a national decision.  Congressional action usually treats the entire country as a whole, yet even with similar problems in different areas, different solutions may be called for.         And while I often don't agree with the decisions my local and state reps make, at least I have a better option of going to the city council and shooting my mouth off.  I'd much rather the majority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end up having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in Washington with half a million or more constituents.         I'm curious what you base your assumption that lower levels are more corrupt.    >|>       I fail to see where any restrictions, implied or otherwise, were >|>placed on the veto.

Phill, *you* brought up the Federalist papers.  We were arguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of Senators should be allowed to hold up a bill.  You claimed the Senate was suppose to be a far less powerful House, and I contended there was nothing in the Constitution or other writings which indicated this. Which was when you brought up that we can't decide what the founders wanted based on the Federalist papers.  You argued against them, I never argued from them.  I have primarily referred to the Constitution, which places only very small restrictions on the Senate than for the House.  >The  >US constitution gives almost no reasoning as to how it should work.

To a certain extend I do believe the veto has become something it wasn't intended.  However, I also believe it is inevitable considering the Congress' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they want them to say.  Unlike most people I think we shouldn't be worrying about the veto, which is fine, but of the problem in Congress which almost necessitates its abuse.  >|>       There is no limit in the Constitution to the President's veto power >|>regarding what a bill is for.

No, I am completely happy with a system which requires a minority for *action*.  Since U.S. history is a history of carving up population groups and implementing piece-meal on minorities, I feel minorities should have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough about.  And 41% is hardly a tiny minority.  I don't advocate the minority being capable of initiating actionm but I see no problem with biasing the *federal* system against action.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ David Veal Univ. of Tenn.

It sounds like you're suggesting  Bill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death. Au contraire; he was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn't all-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when everyone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy Campanella.   >Both of these young men were highly touted defensive catchers, >expected to be among the best ever in baseball.

He's a much better hitter, although Hernandez isn't a *bad* hitter. Right now, it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez will be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler. As long as they play up to their abilities, the Dodgers could have a very good catching tandem.    >The Braves options are Berryhill and Olson.

I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcher defense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at is opponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners. Catchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases.     As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that they're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard plays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak  defensively if Blauser plays. I'd like to see the Braves give at least one of Mel Nieves, Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot, but much like the talent-rich Jays of recent years they'll be conservative and stick with what they have.  I'm not saying that's wrong, just conservative.    --  Dave Hung Like a Jim Acker Slider Kirsch      Blue Jays - Do it again in '93  kirsch@staff.tc.umn.edu                        New .. quotes out of context!

The Cubs are worse  The 1961 Angels were  1/2 game out of 7th. The Athletics and  expansion Senators finished tied for last.  The 1962 Colt 45's finshed 8th - ahead of the Cubs (the Mets were last). The 1969 Royals finshed 4th - ahead of the White Sox (the Pilots in last). The 1977 Mariners finished 6th - ahead of the Athletics(in last).

In 1933,'34 and '35 they also finished second ( though they were only 7, 7 and 3 games out). Even great teams can lose - That's why they play the season. (on the other hand...

Cree Research makes them (probably along with other companies...  Cree is big in materials science, though; they advertise in the stuff like Physics Today, etc.).  You can buy them from JameCo (I think), DigiKey (definitely), and plenty of other distributors.  Actually, these days you _can_ get a "typical visible light" LED -- it's called a "rainbow LED", and I've forgotten who makes it (they advertise in EDN and many of the other trade rags, though).  It combines a reg, green, and blue LED all on one chip (and has four leads).  Nifty device, although it's probably fairly expensive.  					---Joel Kolstad

Perhaps the reason is simple--maybe the marketing people who put together the brochures and price lists weren't clear on the FPU issue.   Afterall, Apple's literature is not always 100% correct. A funny one I noticed recently is that some of the brochures on the Macs with CD capability refer to the "auto inkjet" feature. This should have read "auto inject" feature (as it does on some other correct brochures I've seen from Apple). Since it was correct on some older brochures, I can only guess that someone edited the copy, saw "inject" and thought it was a typo and changed it to the more familiar word "inkjet".  Hmmm, what would that be? A printer built into the CD player? A way of *writing* information to a CD? :-) :-)

In other words, there was no evidence of illegal arms, just enough of a suggestion to get a judge to sign a license to search for illegal evidence.  Question:  As in the Rodney King case, will the US DOJ institute criminal civil rights proceedings against the BATF?  Or at least an investigation?  OK, sorry I asked.

You're assuming that their normal rotation carries all areas of the surface into sunlight.  Not so.  Even on Earth, each pole gets several weeks without sunlight in mid-winter.  Pluto and Charon have much more extreme axial tilt and a much longer orbit.  Pluto's north pole, for example, gets over a century of darkness followed by over a century of perpetual light.  At the moment, we're in luck -- Pluto and Charon are just past their equinox, when the Sun was just on the horizon at both poles (of each). If we get probes there soon, only the immediate vicinity of one pole (on each) will be in long-term shadow.  This will get steadily worse the longer we wait. --  All work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology                     - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry

It isn't Apple's responsibility to tell its customers how to fool around with it's hardware. That is what Apple Service Techs get paid to do. I personally like the design of the Q800, and applaud Apple for coming up with a good way to make use of the front space for all of those drive bays. I like it a lot better than the 900/950 design, except for those people who need Drive Arrays. I do, however, agree with you about the LW Pro design.  >The operation isn't very complicated if even a minimal amount of help were >offered but Apple leaves you working blind.      Again, its's not Apple's place to make it easy for non-certified service people to fool around with Apple hardware, even if they did buy it. Of course you are free to do what you want to your Mac, just don't get upset when your Apple Service Rep tells you that your warranty is no longer valid.  >After the memory was installed I was distraught that the top of the SIMMs >came into contact with the plastic case frame.

This sounds like the kind of problem I had when I installed 4MB SIMMs into an LC, back before low-profile 4MB SIMMs were readily available. The standard 4MB SIMMs would contact the top of the case and make it a bit difficult to close the LC, but it did close and work just fine. One of the nice things about Logic-Boards is that they are generally quite flexible and can withstand a fair amount of pressure.  -Hades

X X XGOALS OF THE CONTEST: X X    * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below. X    * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way. X    * To stress C compilers with unusual code. X    * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language. X    * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X X XRULES: X X    To help us with the volume of entries, we ask that you follow these rules: X X    1) Your entry must be a complete program. X X    2) Your entry must be <= 3217 bytes in length.  The number of characters X       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or } X       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536. X X    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format: X X---entry--- Xrule:	1993 Xfix:	y or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry) Xtitle:	title of entry  		    (see comments below) Xentry:	Entry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0) Xdate:	Date/time of submission in UTC	    (see comments below) Xhost:	Machine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested X	Use tab indented lines if needed X---remark--- X    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if X    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a X    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th X    column.  Blank lines are permitted. X---author--- Xname:	your name Xorg:	School/Company/Organization Xaddr:	postal address X	use tab indented lines to continue X	don't forget to include the country Xemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain. X        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines. Xanon:	y or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info) X---info--- XIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in Xthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info Xsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section. X---build--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting Xfile must be 255 bytes or less. X---program--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode Xinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2. X---end--- X X      Regarding the above format: X X	* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]* X	  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length. X X	  It is suggested, but not required, that the title should X	  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors, X	  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors. X X	* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect X	  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime()  X	  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info) X X	* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending X	  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the  X	  ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same  X	  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be  X	  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well. X X	* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above  X	  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges X	  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate X	  Email message to the judges. X X	* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless  X	  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line. X X	* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for X	  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and X	  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections. X X	* The entry's remarks should include: X	    - what this program does X	    - how to run the program (sample args or input) X	    - special compile or execution instructions, if any X	    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5) X	    - information about any ---data--- files X	    - why you think the program is obfuscated X	    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry. X	    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise) X X	* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain X	  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award. X X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They  X	  should not be required to exist. X X	  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info--- X	  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple  X	  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe X	  each info file in the ---remark--- section. X X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows: X X	   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed X	   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional X	       digit, followed by '.c' X	   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's X	       title, possibly followed by a digit X X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of X       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed X       by a digit, followed by '.sh'. X X       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames. X X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files, X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this X       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks. X X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected. X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not  X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected. X X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is X       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to: X X		...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate X		obfuscate@toad.com X X       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'. X X       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries X       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted, however. X       We will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for X       all entries received after 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC. X X    9) Each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year.  Each entry X       must be sent in a separate Email letter. X X   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed.   X       Compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be executed. X X   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid, setgid, super-user, X       special owner or group) are not allowed. X     X XFOR MORE INFORMATION: X X    The Judging will be done by Landon Noll and Larry Bassel.

X XABOUT THIS FILE: X X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short). X X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993: X X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers  X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with  X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor  X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: X X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be 'old' the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to an entry: X X	* look at the original source X	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines X	* run it through a C beautifier X	* examine the algorithm X	* lint it X	* compile it X	* execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting "this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake" would save the above entry.  And sometimes, X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES: X X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we: X X	#define d define X	#d foo		   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo X X	int i; X	j;		   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration X	int k; X X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you  X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in  X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type. X    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed: X X	int i; X	char *c; X	i[c];		   <--- use c[i] instead X	(i+3)["string"];   <--- use "string"[i+3] instead X X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are X    not portable and must not be used: X X	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables X	* using va_list as a structure or union X X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. X X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...), X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for X    programs that are compact, and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programs that: X X	* are very hardware specific X	* are very OS or Un*x version specific X	     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific X	      code is likely not to be) X	* dump core or have compiler warnings X	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) X	* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit X	* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X	* are longer than they need to be X	* are similar to previous winners X	* are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out, X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programs that: X X	* are as concise and small as they need to be X	* do something at least quasi-interesting X	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice) X	* are portable X	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X	* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X	* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRY FORMAT: X X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format, X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found in mkentry.c: X X	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X	an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases, X	where this program differs from the contest rules, the X	contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X	contest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however, X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below) X X    The following is a sample entry: X X---entry--- Xrule:	1993 Xfix:	n Xtitle:	chonglab Xentry:	0 Xdate:	Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993 Xhost:	Un*x v6, pdp11/45 X	2.9BSD, pdp11/70 X---remark--- X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.

You should try to avoid X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch. X X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files, X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed, X    then skip the ---info--- section. X X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a X    'hints' file. X X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental, X    the entry should not require them exist. X X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason, X    say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say X    so in the ---remark--- section. X X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should X    have entry number 0. X X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the  X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at: X X	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for X	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries) X     X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer  X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as  X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is: X X	Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many  X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string: X X	date -u "+%a %h %d %T 19%y" X	date -u | sed -e 's/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/' X	sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"' X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"' X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e "s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"' X X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'. X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be X    replaced. X X XJUDGING PROCESS: X X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll. X X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing: X X	---entry--- section X	all ---author--- sections X	all ---info--- sections X	---build--- section X	---program--- section X	any other text, including the Email message headers X X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award. X X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding X    out in the end, who won and where they were from. X X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award. X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious, X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X    winners at talks) X X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. X X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round, X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings. X X    A reading consists of a number of actions: X X	* reading the ---entry--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any X	* passing the source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X	* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X X    In later rounds, other actions are performed: X X	* linting the source X	* compiling/building the source X	* running the program X	* performing misc tests on the source and binary X X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round. X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards. X    An entry often will compete in several categories. X X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X    we receive.  A typical category list might be: X X	* best small one line program X	* best small program X	* strangest/most creative source layout X	* most useful obfuscated program X	* best game that is obfuscated X	* most creatively obfuscated program X	* most deceptive C code X	* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES) X	* best abuse of ANSI C X	* worst abuse of the rules X	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> X X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary. X X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry  X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,  X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS: X X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition, X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF. X X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups: X X	    comp.lang.c		  comp.unix.wizards	alt.sources X X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following X X	    comp.sources.d	  alt.sources.d		misc.misc X	    comp.sources.misc	  comp.windows.x X X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See X    below for details. X X    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners  X    have appeared in books ("The New Hackers Dictionary") and on T-Shirts. X X    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-) X X XFOR MORE INFORMATION: X X    You may contact the judges by sending Email to the following address: X X	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for X	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries) X X    Questions and comments about the contest are welcome. X X    One may obtain a copy of the current rules, guidelines or mkentry X    program.  To obtain all 3 of them, send Email to the address above  X    and use the subject 'send rules'.

Their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution, crudely speaking, indicates we're seeing an edge to the distribution.     Given the enormous  power,  i was just wondering,  what if they are    quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by?     Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges?     Now, in the good old days before GRO data, it was thought the gamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy, it was expected that GRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population (within a few hundred light years) or that they were in the galactic halo. (Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed) (also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was probably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...) 	As the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo population should show anisotropy (a local disk population is ruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you have to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanism of getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should start to see for example the Andromeda's bursters. 	The data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution (but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with the right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (hence isotropy) and the edge is "the edge of the Universe" ;-) If at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect) and a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron star colliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then getting the spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.  	If we know anything about physics at that level, the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic strings, wrong spectrum for one thing.  The situation is further complicated by recent claims that there are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NS they'd actually probably fit relatively easily into the NS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]     my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering    hyperspace :-)     but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they    are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered    if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.

It would also be great for another reason - when not docked, it could serve as an ARA server to the large internal HD, your corporate email, etc.  In a pinch, you would also have two machines, instead of 1.5.

Here is a rewrite of my Mac & Info sheet SCSI section: SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.  Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card   expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Normal {asynchronous}  SCSI is 5 Mhz;  fast {synchronous} SCSI is 10 Mhz.  Difference between these  modes is mainly in the software drivers.  Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal   terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port   {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and end.   Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}.  SCSI-1:  8-bit; 7 devices per SCSI controller.  asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}  and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  8-bit SCSI-2 is often mistaken for  a fast version of SCSI-1 {see SCSI-2 for details}. SCSI-2: fully SCSI-1 compliant. SCSI-2 mode - 10 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit SCSI-2 is implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it can run using  SCSI-1 hardware and software drivers which limits it to 7 devices, which  results in it sometimes being mistakenly consitered part of SCSI-1.  16-bit  and 32-bit SCSI-2 require different ports, electronics, and SCSI software  drivers from SCSI-1 {Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI  interfaces}.  32-bit SCSI seems to run only in synchronous mode, hence term  'wide and fast SCSI' Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit},  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst  {32-bit}.  8-bit SCSI-2 is the BIGGEST headache due to the fact that it is the ONLY SCSI-2  that I know of that can pump SCSI-2 speeds through SCSI-1 devices and software controlers.  Its MAIN implimentation is on the Mac though you do see adds for SCSI-2 at 10MB/s maximum throughput for PCs.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 does NOT NEED all the hardware {including electonics} and software of 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 it is the CHEEPEST of the SCSI-2 interfaces.  Just pop out the SCSI-1 electornics and pop in 8-bit SCSI-2 electronics.  Some people consider 16-bit where SCSI-2 REALLY starts {I USED to be one of them} but 4-6MB/s average though put with a theoretical burst of 10MB/s is NOT SCSI-1 but is 8-bit SCSI-2. Rule of thumb: if it is SCSIn and OVER 5MB/s then it is SOME type of SCSI-2.  8-bit SCSI CAN use part of SCSI-1 electronics which further reduces its cost compared to 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2.

Look at the history of this group. David Koresh has been arrested ?twice?  by local police. Both times, he accepted the arrest warrant and went peacefully. So, the feds decide to arrest him. How do they choose to arrest a person with a record of peaceful obedience under arrest? They throw a concussion grenades at his building.   In addition, we KNOW that we've been lied to. Initially, we were told that they suspected him of molesting children and having several wives. But these are NOT ATF offenses, were they? So they changed their story, several times. And the original warrant is STILL sealed. And we were told about the rockets and ammunition they had... but did anyone notice any ammo exploding in the fire? They claimed that Koresh hadn't left the compound in months... but people in town report seeing him just a week before the raid.  How would I have handled it differently?   Well, first, I haven't seen any evidence that the BDs did anything wrong. There's a sealed warrant, and a collection of stories which keep changing about what they did. So I might not have done ANYTHING.  OK. Now, supposing that I know what the BDs are being arrested for. Well, they've got a history of accepting arrests... so, I send officers to the door with a warrant. Wearing bulletproof vests. Covered from a distance by sharpshooters. Now, there's no good reason to suspect that these people will do anything, right? Why didn't anyone TRY serving a warrant?  OK. Going further. They refuse the warrant. It becomes necessary to raid. You plan a raid. You hear an hour before that there was a leak, and they know your coming. SO what do you do?  Well, change your plans, right? Nope... they go ahead with it anyone... including sending in unprotected men to break into the place. It was idiotic. I don't know what I would have ended up doing. But that original raid should NEVER have happened.  The shit that came later should NEVER have happened.  The full record of the raid should be released to the public to let us know what the hell really happened there.

Just briefly, on something that you mentioned in passing. You refer to      differing interpretations of "create," and say that many Christians may      not agree. So what? That is really irrelevant. We do not base our faith      on how many people think one way or another, do we? The bottom line is      truth, regardless of popularity of opinions.       Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created      and eternally existent are equivalent, you say "granted the Mormon      belief..." You can't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to      have been addressed. In order to reply to the issue, you have to address      and answer the point that was raised, and not just jump to the      conclusion that you grant.       The Bible states that Lucifer was created.  The Bible states that Jesus      is the creator of all. The contradiction that we have is that the LDS      belief is that Jesus and Lucifer were the same.  ra> >     Your point that we all are brothers of Jesus and Lucifer is also ra> >     heretical, since we are not innately brothers and sisters of Christ. ra> >     We are adopted, "For ye have not received the spirit of bondage ra> >     again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby ra> >     we cry, Abba, Father."

(John 1:12-13) ra> ra>    Has it occured to you, Robert, that being "born of" someone or being ra> of that person (or Person)'s "family" may be a symbolic term in the New ra> Testament?  Mormons believe that we are "adopted" into the House of ra> Israel through baptism and faith in Christ, although some have expressed ra> belief that this does evince a physical change in our bodies.       The Mormon belief is that all are children of God. Literally. There is      nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible      says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:            The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the            kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked [one];           (Matthew 13:38)            I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which            ye have seen with your father. (John 8:38)            Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not            born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.  Jesus said            unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I            proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he            sent me.  Why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye            cannot hear my word.  Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the            lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the            beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in            him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a            liar, and the father of it. (John 8:41-44)            And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of            the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease            to pervert the right ways of the Lord? (Acts 13:10)            Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this            world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit            that now worketh in the children of disobedience: (Ephesians 2:2)            In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the            devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he            that loveth not his brother. (1 John 3:10)       One becomes a child of God...            But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the           sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name: (John 1:12)            Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that           we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us           not, because it knew him not.  Beloved, now are we the sons of God,           and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when           he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he           is. (1 John 3:1-2)       ...when he is born again through faith in Jesus Christ:            Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of           the will of man, but of God. (John 1:13)            Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus           Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,           (Ephesians 1:5)            Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should           be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. (James 1:18)            For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of           God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;           but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,           Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we           are the children of God: (Romans 8:14-16)            Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one           that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. (1 John 4:7)            Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and           every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is           begotten of him.

Whose "Jesus of the Bible" do you mean?       This is really a red herring. It doesn't address any issue raised, but       rather, it seeks to obfuscate. The fact that some groups try to read       something into the Bible, doesn't change what the Bible teaches. For       example, the fact that the Jehovah's Witnesses deny the Deity of Christ       does not alter what the Bible teaches [ "Looking for that blessed hope,      and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus      Christ;" (Titus 2:13),"Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus      Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through      the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:" (2 Peter 1:1)]       on the Deity of Christ.       We first look to the Bible to see what it teaches. To discount, or not       even address, what the Bible teaches because there are some groups that       have differing views is self-defeating. To see what the Bible teaches,       you have to look at the Bible.  ra> >     "Our Lord's mortality was essential to his own salvation" (_The ra> >     Promised Messiah_, p. 456), "He had to work out his own salvation by ra> >     doing the will of the Father in all things" (ibid., p.54), "he had ra> >     to be baptized to gain admission to the celestial kingdom" (_Mormon ra> >     Doctrine_, p.71). ra> ra>    Welcome to the wonderful world of Mormon paradoctrine, Robert.

The conclusions I come to may seem "heretical" to ra> you, but I'm prepared to accept that.       I find this rather curious. When I mentioned that the Mormon belief is      that Jesus needed to be saved, I put forward some quotes from the late      apostle, Bruce McConkie. The curious part is that no one addressed the      issue of `Jesus needing to be saved.' Rick comes the closest with his "I      have my own conclusions" to addressing the point.       Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of      Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' I don't      think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon. That is not the      issue.  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this      subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may       certainly be.   ============================= Robert Weiss psyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu

Somebody correct (flame) me please!   You miss the point.  A lot more negotiation is needed to convince women to have sex because there is a big taboo about women being free with  their sex.  Many of the women I know would do almost anything rather than be known as a slag, slut or whore.  With men however there is *status* attached to being able to fuck  constantly.  And with gay men, where both partners can prove status through their constant verility then you are going to get a situation where there is a lot of sex.  The difference is between het sex being rationed as a valuable commodity and gay sex being virtually unlimited due to the *appetites* of men.  Straights suffer a bottle neck where women are concerned, gay men who do not experience this bottle neck go to excess.   >--  >Mark Walsh (walsh@optilink) -- UUCP: uunet!optilink!walsh   Xavier

I had a '82 Saab 900 Turbo, and now have a '87 BMW 325is  There is no comparison for handling, reliability, or overall quality of engineering. The BMW wins hands down. After 5 years I was sick and tired of the all the little problems and entropic decay of the SAAB. The 6-year old BMW is still as sweet as it was new.  But I see you are posting from western MA. BMW's **SUCK** in the snow. I have aggressive snows, plus a hundred pounds of sand in the back, and I still try to avoid driving in the snow.

The willingness of the majority of the people to give up their freedom in  exchange for a sense of safety is hardly limited to the USA, and is an  endemic problem in any human society of any appreciable size.  The structure  of the US government does try to combat this tendency to some extent, but  fighting entropy is always a losing battle.  Most people would rather have  comfort than freedom.  The paradox is that you can't really have the former,  in the long term, unless you have the latter.  One of the reasons that I probably come across to some people as a weird  cross between a libertarian and an "establishment tool" is that I end up  taking an utterly pragmatic view of government.  I don't get up in arms when  the government fails to protect the interests of the people, because in my  lifetime it never has--therefore, I have no expectation that it will.    As a result, I protect my own interests rather than expecting the government  to be "fair".  I will use strong cryptography when I think it is needed,  whether or not it is legal at the time.  Same thing with anything else the  government would rather not see in private hands--that's their problem.   What's important to me is using the right tool for the job.  If it's legal,  so much the better.  If it is not, but does not violate my (very strong)  sense of personal ethics, I will use it anyway as long I think it is worth  it.  Expecting the government to actually protect the interests of its  citizens, except by accident, is utter folly.  Even Jefferson, one of the  major architects of the American system of government, figured that in a  couple hundred years it would become so corrupt and self-serving that it  would be time dismantle it and try again, by revolution if necessary.  I  agree, and while I don't go around trying to spark one, I'll certainly  participate if it happens when I'm around.  There is a reason I am such a  strong supporter of individual rights while being so cynical about politics.   I've already written off politics.  And yes, this may get me in trouble some day.  If so, so be it.  I drive  faster than 55 MPH, too.   Amanda Walker InterCon Systems Corporation

They aren't saying much, but they apparently like Niedermayer and Victor Kozlov, along with Kariya.  Chris Pronger's name has also been mentioned.  My guess is that they'll take Niedermayer.

Not the individual players.  There is no method >inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that >is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.  There's an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball team and some people's conception of a biological organism.  In the biology context, we would very likely read "fitness" for "the score of the game" and "organisms" for "teams".  How we interpret "players" is trickier, but either "organs", or "genes" might seem reasonable choices depending on what point we were trying to make.  A "genes" interpretation actually might be really interesting in this case,  but that would be a different and probably longer post.  If, however, we take the "organ" view, then our knowledge of biology should make us pause before we start saying things like "species X is more fit than species Y because of a better organ Z".  Given what we know about the interdependence of organs, we would often be suspicious of such claims.  (But note that this type of argument is quite often made when you map "species X" onto 'humans', and "organ Z" onto 'brain').  On the other hand, some statements of this kind do seem more reasonable than others, as far as we can test them (e.g. 'brain' above might be more reasonable than 'pancreas' assuming no gross pathology, particularly if species Y is a primate).  Even when you make such statements, you should be concerned with the functioning of the whole organism, and the possibility that one organ might be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another. (Not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial in some third species.)  However, if we are non-vitalists with any kind of reductionsit streak, we will want to say that an organism is not some completely magical unanalyzable "whole" but an intriguing process made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are potentially observable.  Some of these processes might be localized to particular organs, while others may be distributed across multiple organs.  In a way, this is just like a baseball team, except that I think it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved in baseball are *much* simpler and less numerous than in most organisms.  >To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab- >solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B >in their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.  One thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly controlled experiments are sometimes very tough to do.  But, of course, this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they can, and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the absence of certainty.  Most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation, but even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research.  >If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens >has done better [than another pitcher] with those statistics as a >criteria, then fine.  In this cases, we're seeing the word "statistics" means "summary of observed events", where the events themselves can be viewed as the output of some process, and possibly inputs for other processes. Thus, if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together into the functioning organism, data in the form of statistics might give us a basis to test particular hypotheses.  >But you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the >individual's contribution to winning the WS - because that is the only >measure of "best" that has any meaning in the context of baseball.  This statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again. Fitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment; you might be fit in one situation and not another.  Moving to baseball, it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an environment including all the other teams in the league.  In at least a nominal sense, the division winners are the fittest teams in the league, in that they (on average) had better fitness scores than any of their competing opponennts.  But in a real sense, there is a fairly large random component in the performance of each team that is difficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors intrinsic to (or interesting for) baseball.  The same is true in biology.  But here is also no direct biological equivalent of the World Series in basebal.  In the world series, the random component may be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played, and both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement where they were originally successful.  It might be fun to watch, but it's unclear what it all really means.  ***  Now just one more un-related point:  >I have yet to see that any of you can predict a >WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.  On the other hand, you have seen some of us who can predict the outcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of teams to finishes, and maybe some of us (e.g. me) who can do this better than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis. But this is probably only due to the fact that a 162-game schedule gives you a little hope that bad hops aren't the only difference between the winners and the losers.  Moreover, you've had the opportunity to see some analysis of the World Series situation that makes the strong claim that *nobody* can predict the WS winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only to reflect the well-known home vs. road effect on winning percentage.  >The stats are a nice hobby and that's about it.  There is no new >knowledge being produced.    Since stats are summaries of events, it's true that if you know the events you can derive the stats.  But if somebody is trying to understand the process behind the stats, then the stats produce new knowledge, and some of this might even be reliable, repeatable, and useful.  Speaking of which, I should get back to producing knowledge in a different field.  That is, of course, if I can produce knowledge even though I'm relying on stats to do it.  jking

I am doubting a claim presented without any evidence to support it.  If you are able to present real evidence for it, then great.  But unsupported claims, or even claims by such and such news agency will not be accepted.  If you want to stick to the sheer impossible, instead of the merely difficult, then fine.    The statement that if such a fact is classified, then you  can't prove it, is a simple matter of pragmatics and the law.  If you  have access to classified information that you know to be classified, and you reveal it, there is a good chance that you or someone else  (the person who revealed it to you), is going to jail.    I never said that you couldn't prove it to my satisfaction, I merely said that it was difficult.

Indeed.)  the flat four is also shorter than an inline 4, so even if it is mounted longitudinally it will not take up lots of length.. and a longitudinal placement is easier for a 4 wheel drive drivetrain.  i think that subaru's ads hold water.  in practice, their flat fours are noticeably smoother than inline 4s and completely buzz free, though some may not like its peculiar note.  but as alfa has shown, a boxer four can produce a spine tingling scream that only the likes of recent hondas can approach.   eliot

I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil. spec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C and sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time delay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this application, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger pins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is disabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset. When triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x the timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can be programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting any combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it is, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K resistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of 2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !) Of course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for 256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'. After the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14 day timing cycle and so forth.  Power is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the electronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet puker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to keep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to work for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts to spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to see what I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one that has to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns off ;-)  Thanks again everyone...  -=-= Wes =-=-

Whilst I have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some relevant books are listed in a companion article.  To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.  Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions posed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect questions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians who proselytize on alt.atheism.  So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as Christianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine being.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it may not.  "What is atheism?"  Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God. Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is often referred to as the "weak atheist" position, and the latter as "strong atheism".  It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  "Weak atheism" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  "Strong atheism" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are "strong atheists".  Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their atheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making flat-out denials.  "But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?"  Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe it to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to believing that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or not.  Which brings us to agnosticism.  "What is agnosticism then?"  The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who disclaimed ("strong") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things must be some cause unknown and unknowable.  Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for sure whether God exists.  Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that you can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people use agnosticism to mean "weak atheism", and use the word "atheism" only when referring to "strong atheism".  Beware also that because the word "atheist" has so many shades of meaning, it is very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for sure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn't the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out about the universe.  "So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?"  There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a particular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.  Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions is essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that such a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they see no evidence that God exists.  "But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?"  There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than all other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects obeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly well-defined is a matter for debate.  However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably impossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of God.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.  If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in question is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing might be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search is often impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest primes, because we can prove that they don't exist.  Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist unless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of the time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusively prove that no unicorns exist anywhere.  To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be tested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to prove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by default that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.  Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God exists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover varieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be possible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious book does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described by any present-day religion exists.  In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very close to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different that counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of God are not really applicable.  "But what if God is essentially non-detectable?"  If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction must be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be detectable.  If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he does not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue that if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no importance whether he exists or not.  If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites. Surely he should still be detectable today?  Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically verifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some effect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him from all the other things that don't exist?  "OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but  isn't it still a religious belief?"  One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is "the redefinition game".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:  Person A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out that it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the statement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He then records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to it, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an "agreed fact", but uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure redefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen to be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.  The point of this digression is that the answer to the question "Isn't atheism a religious belief?" depends crucially upon what is meant by "religious".  "Religion" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman controlling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and worship.  [ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not   "religion" according to such a definition. ]  Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it categorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of "religious" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as "religious" as well -- such as science, politics, and watching TV.  "OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is  still just an act of faith, like religion is?"  Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one actually believes in.  Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to questioning if experience throws them into doubt.  Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are the sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called "acts of faith", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on acts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.  Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something. According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of faith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as religious followers when claiming that something is "certain".  This is not a general tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exists.  Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof. Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheism has no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, as even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or the lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.  "If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?"  It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either "for" or "against", "friend" or "enemy".  The truth is not so clear-cut.  Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense, it can be said to be "anti-religion".  However, when religious believers speak of atheists being "anti-religious" they usually mean that the atheists have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.  This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair. Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.  Most atheists take a "live and let live" attitude.  Unless questioned, they will not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of course, this may be in part because atheism is not "socially acceptable" in many countries.  A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to "convert" others when possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little impact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.  (To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation of church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to worship as they wished.  The institution of "state atheism" came about when Stalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in order to gain complete power over the population.)  Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see religion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example, the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that church and state should remain separate.  "But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,  surely that's the same as state atheism?"  The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall not legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it means not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of another, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in nature.  Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For example, religious believers have historically been responsible for encouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as religious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters, and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists are quite happy to see them have their say.  "What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people  pray?"  Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things that those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in schools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they need not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event.  Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable to care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other motives.  "You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about  atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't  atheists object to the religious charities?"  There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can contribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for the sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work for charities founded on a theistic basis.  Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about in connection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday matter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to say self-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set of religious beliefs.  To "weak" atheists, building a hospital to say "I do not believe in God" is a rather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say "Today is not my birthday".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.  "You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against  one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?"  Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to force any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people choose to call themselves atheists.  It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a backlash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the other hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the expectations of others.  On the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion are backlash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think independently.  "How do atheists differ from religious people?"  They don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.  Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a Verdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts, they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many Buddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy of the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!  Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without realising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and appearance.  "Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?"  That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course atheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when one talks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable ("right") and unacceptable ("wrong") behaviour within society.  Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must co-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most atheists from "anti-social" or "immoral" behaviour, purely for the purposes of self-preservation.  Many atheists behave in a "moral" or "compassionate" way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care what happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.  Naturally, there are some people who behave "immorally" and try to use atheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who behave "immorally" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their actions.  For example:    "Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ    came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was    shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited    patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive    eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,    be honor and glory forever and ever."  The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992 by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a religious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?     A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior    deteriorated after "born again" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents    said they had driven intoxicated before being "born again," 12% had done    so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before    conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex    before salvation; 5% after.                                 ["Freethought Today", September 1991, p. 12.]  So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral behaviour.  "Is there such a thing as atheist morality?"  If you mean "Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?", then the answer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality which are at least as strong as those held by religious people.  If you mean "Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?", then the answer is no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person will behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same "moral rules" as theists, but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by humans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, rather than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.  "Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?"  A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for them.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible with what they observed around them.  Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are unbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time studying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.  This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that individual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice of atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only choice that person can honestly make.  "But don't atheists want to believe in God?"  Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many of them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the "Big Brother" figure might be.  Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should one believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of such an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to believe something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.  "But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are  unwilling in their souls to see!"  Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained above, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God exists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.  Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded. Comments such as "Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly" are likely to be viewed as patronizing.  Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are being sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is futile.  "Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?"  Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives meaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives count, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other people who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to political reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.  It is a natural human tendency to look for "meaning" or "purpose" in random events.  However, it is by no means obvious that "life" is the sort of thing that has a "meaning".  To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually a sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking "What is the meaning of life?" is as silly as asking "What is the meaning of a cup of coffee?".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.  "So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?"  There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets. Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.  That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so what?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?  In the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's just hard luck.  "Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?"  The short answer is "No, do you?"  Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.  Thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof of the existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely to be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.  "So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments  apply?"  No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is the sceptical "default position" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism is a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.  Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs because of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers, but to everyone else.  "What sort of harm?"  Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's not just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings; think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on. Imagine how that effort could be better spent.  Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances of ill people being "healed" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines prescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.  It is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- and condoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many third-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.  Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different religion.  "Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some  sort of excuse."  What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hard to tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all convinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight and kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REAL Christian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like the Catholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?  In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who calls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his actions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians are just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if the Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't be much of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he have made it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs aren't a perversion of what your God intended?  If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so? Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered others because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a Christian.  "Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since  nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely  that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense."  That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue, positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much harder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns don't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.  It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, "weak" atheists would argue that asserting nothing is better still.  "Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?"  Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how "correct" it is, or whether it "works"; consider how many people believe in astrology, graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.  Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in gods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.  Of course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world, we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when there are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started as a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other purposes as well.  "But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say  something?"  Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it's worth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of concept of God in the Christian sense.  Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it's rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.  "What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded  that God exists?"  For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who does not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is not determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the same way that theists view their religious leaders.  A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.  "So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates  nothing?"  Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has properties which have helped it so spread so far.  The theory of memetics talks of "memes" -- sets of ideas which can propagate themselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by encouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by discouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure to keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by other memes.  Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with successful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of the number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing because of the number of people who have caught it.  "Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important  messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?"  There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a few of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some religions.     There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.     Be especially sceptical of positive claims.     If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to    find it.     Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.     Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.     It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change    yourself.     Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.     If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.     Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.  and finally (and most importantly):     All beliefs should be open to question.

I have looked at several tools but they all seem basically the same (each salesman will beg to differ). I realize that there are differences but I don't have an infinate amount of time to discover what they are. The tools I have looked at so far are UIM/X, X-designer, Tele-Use, tcl/tk,Interviews, and SUIT.  So far I've drawn the following conclusions:  1) The builder for Interviews is not very mature, bad docs 2) Tele-Use is very expensive and uses a proprietary toolkit 3) UIM/X & X-designer seem about the same, even though X-designer does not have a interpreter (I'll by Centerline if I need one) 4) tcl/tk is a little buggy 5) I know very little about the ICS Builder (just have the sales info) 6) Due to a corporate agreement X-designer is much cheeper than any other comercial product. 7) For the time I'm spending I could have bought all of them (well different money) 8) We will have to live with any shortcomings and make it work 9) this type of tool seems great, but noone seems to talk about them on the net. Is there another news group for this ? 10) SUIT cost too much for comercial development.  I'm hoping someone out there has a strong opinion on at least one of these products.  thanks   --- *	Bruce Trvalik  AOA-----------------* *       (617)864-0201   check your mind at the door - The Band That Time Forgot *	moose@aoa.utc.com *       aoa!moose@bbn.com

There was an interesting column on the editorial page of the Dallas Morning News on Saturday by Walter Williams, who I believe is a professor at Georgetown (I wonder if he knows of Dorothy "you're not in Kansas anymore" Denning).  The article was titled "Government slowly eroding our liberties", and in it he tells a story attributed to the late Leonard Read who          explained that if you wanted to take liberty away from         Americans, you had to know how to cook a frog.  Mr. Read         said you can't cook a frog by boiling a pot of water and         then throwing the frog in.  His reflexes are so quick that         as soon as his feet touch the water, he will leap away.         You must put the frog in a pot of cold water and heat it         up bit by bit.  By the time the frog realizes he's being         cooked, it is too late.  It is the same with Americans.         If anyone tried to take our freedoms all at once, we         would naturally rebel and suppress the tyrant.  But as         with successful frog cooking, our liberties can be taken         a little bit at a time.  The last line of the article says, "It's not too late for us, but the water is getting pretty warm."  I'd have toagree that it's warm and the Clipper is keeping the temperature on an upward course.

Under the assumption that things are as they are, and the seller is not the owner (I assume this is what you mean) then one can say that with high confidence that this is a bad deal for any tourist, regardless of their private beliefs.  There isn't enough information to draw good conclusions about the seller - but one could say (with less confidence) that it can be a good deal for any seller.   That the seller and buyer come out with different values on the deal is  *not* relativism since in fact any number of disinterested observers can  predict this, which sounds pretty objective to me.  --  Frank O'Dwyer                                  'I'm not hatching That' odwyer@sse.ie                                  from "Hens",  by Evelyn Conlon

I know that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds, yet hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless, saying' You fools, do you still think that just believing is enough?'  Now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves and not by God, according to Romans that person is still saved by there faith. But then there is the bit which says that God preferes someone who is cold to him (i.e. doesn't know him - condemned) so a lukewarm Christian someone who knows and believes in God but doesn't make any attempt to live by the bible.  Now I am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone (not what you do) as taught in Romans, but how can I square up in my mind the teachings of James in conjunction with the lukewarm Christian being 'spat-out'  Can anyone help me, this really bothers me.

The heat is then used to heat water just as in a conventional oil or coal station, and the resultant steam drives the turbines.

This won't work if there is a checksum on the keys you don't know about. Neither will registering a clipper chip and then substituting a "counterfeit" one if the serial number contains a checksum.  Chances are the government has thought of this, and "just anyone" won't be permitted access to enough of the internals to make a "fake" clipper chip. Chances are that the government has classified some details of the internals at a very high level, and manufacturers are required to observe security safeguards and clearances corresponding to that level.  While not perfect, it would prevent Joe Hacker from rolling his own spoofing chip, since not many counterfeiters can survive a background investigation. Some of the more notorious self-styled dissidents here, for example, have already got their heads so high above the tall grass that they'd have little chance of getting a clearance.  Of course it's not impossible that someone do this, but probably extremely difficult. Chances are there will also be very heavy criminal penalties for phony clipper chips, on some national security/classified info grounds or other, thus making the game not worth the candle.  --  David Sternlight         Great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of                          our information, errors and omissions excepted.

I'm sure that most SL2 owners will be VERY lucky to get this speed, but 7.9 seconds is still astonishingly fast for a small 4-door.  A new Civic EX runs about 8.2 seconds 0-60, if I'm not mistaken.

Just for the hell of it, let's destroy this remark. Let us imagine that the executive branch actually could extract keys from the escrow houses without anyone knowing, or telling. Now what? Dick has 80 bits of data. What the hell's he gonna do with it?  	1) Trot around to the telco and say 'we'd like an unauthorised decrypting tap'. Uh huh. 	2) Break in to watergate and install his own tap (so his people still do have to break in, neat, huh?) record some noise, then get the Executive Branch Phone Decryption Box (huh? they've got one? Goodness, wait 'til the washington post gets hold of this) and decrypt the noise. 	3) More likely, stare at the key, and say 'Oh, hell it's not worth all this bloody hassle'  	Truth is, even granted *lots* of covert power on the part of the Executive Branch, this system is *more* difficult to tap with than POTS gear. The fact that it is easier to tap than some hypothetical system neither you nor I am going to place on our phones is neither here nor there.  	The only rational concerns I am seeing raised are:  	a) is the key really just chopped in half, and not some XOR arrangement? That is, has some egregious technical error been built in to the plan? 	b) is this is the first step toward strict regulation of strong encryption?   >But that's not really the issue.  The real issue is whether this  >will be used to justify a ban against individuals' use of private  >(i.e., anything else) encryption methods.  	This is b), of course. I suspect not. If the government actually wanted to make such regs, they'd just do it. A few hundred people on Usenet yelling about it wouldn't even slow the machine down.  	Besides, who is this mysterious 'they' who's going to take away all our rights the instant we let our guard down? Congress? That gang of buffoons can't even balance their checkbooks. The FBI?

I want to use this (proposed) beast for basically four things:         -	Editing documents using WordPerfect 5.1 (under dos)       -	Creating graphs/analyzing data using Sigmaplot V5.0 (under dos)       -	Editing/playing with images using Aldus PhotoStyler, running under  	Windows 3.1 - these images can be large, say 2k x 2k, 24bits/pixel       -	Using the PC as an Xterminal, running DesqView/X 1.1 and Sun PC-NFS,  	talking to our network of Sparcstation's - this is where a lot of 	the images/data come from, and is the most demanding of these tasks.  I've read, read, read PC magazines, performed benchmarks, read this newsgroup, and decided that a "nice" system (price/performance) would be:  	486DX-50 256k cache, ISA, VLB, 16meg ram 	ATI Graphics Ultra Pro, 2 meg ram, local bus 	15" monitor, 1280x1024 NI 	3Com Etherlink III 16bit 	Maxtor 240MB IDE hard drive  However, the parts don't fit!  Our local retailer apparently put one of these together, only to discover that the ATI card wouldn't run at 50MHz - surprise surprise.  Actually, after reading this group, I'm surprised that they even have a 50MHz local bus running...  I have a choice now between basically the above system but with a 486DX2-66 with ISA and VLB,  or,   a 486DX-50 with EISA and no VLB (and thus the non-local bus version of the ATI card).  Which is better, keeping in mind that I'm primarily interested in the last two tasks?    Any help would be greatly appreciated!  (I need to decide quickly, so any  speedy help would be appreciated even more!!)    BTW: We have a system now to perform these tasks, it has the following  configuration:  	486DX-33 64k cache, ISA, 8 meg ram 	ATI Graphics Ultra+, 2 meg ram 	14" monitor, 1024x768 NI 	SMC Ethercard 8 bit 	Maxtor 120MB IDE hard drive  We're quite happy with the ATI card - very fast, ONCE the data gets to it!! ~Slow~ repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen, or been uncovered!    There doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView/X!  Its sluggish running the local window manager.  Also, many functions under PhotoStyler take a long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram).  There's not enough memory in the system - DesqView/X and a 1 meg SmartDrive don't leave much room for other apps.  Photostyler will page to disk with medium size images.  I have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates.  This machine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600k/sec  on the same network.  Going to the 16 bit version of the SMC card increases transfer rates to 160k/sec - still very slow (especially when moving large  images).  Is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming??  Will it make a difference?  I'm hoping so, and leaning towards the 486DX2-66 choice  (above), for that reason.  Also, are there DX2-100's on the horizon?  What about DX3-99's?  DX3-150's ???!  Any information is greatly appreciated.  ----- Ross Mitchell, Imaging Research Lab, |   rmitch@irus.rri.uwo.ca John P.

And  when  I  had  the  56SLC  (this is  the  386SLC  system)  running Dos/Windows, I had only  one crash, and it was consistent.   FTP had a tendency  to  crash  whenever  I would  get  large  files (>1mb)  from particularly fast  clients  (DTR's  150K-200K/sec), I  figured out the problem was with smartdrv's write buffering--if I turned off the write buffer, everything would work fine.

Well,  I save all  my  personal files to floppy,  and when  i did that under Windows, a floppy save of a large file hung up the system.  I  also found  it quite bothersome to  have  to  continually tweak the tasking options  on fractint for dos whenever I wanted to do a fractal computation in the background.  >> and not being able to address your memory better than DOS,  >	Not sure what you mean here.  The idea is  that OS/2's DOS sessions can see more memory than Windows DOS  sessions.  I  let  XPL (a  shareware calculus program) see around 720KB of free _conventional_ memory, which lets me  do bigger symbolic manipulations than is possible  under straight DOS (where it would see around 610KB of conventional RAM.).  I  also found it really handy for my _own_ DOS-based programs, which, without  any re-writing, could now handle larger data sets, simulate for more iterations, etc. Of course, the  point is  now moot,  since  the OS/2 programs I now write  simply _never_ run into memory limitations.  I never programmed  for Windows, so I don't have much of a comparison here, though....

Actually I favor government funded research. It *is* a pump prime for a lot of basic technologies. I also understand the short term value of high tech welfare programs. But they can't substitute for long range wealth generation via commercial enterprise. That's what's needed to maintain a healthy economy *anywhere*, on Earth or Luna.

Jesus was taken up to heaven after His 40 day post-resurrection stint and the angels who were there assured the apostles that Jesus would return the same way and that everyone will see the coming. That's why Jesus warned that many would come claiming to be Him but that we would know when Jesus actually returns.

A person from Jesus' culture authorized to conduct business "in John's name" had full authority over John's financial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to work only for John's benefit and consonant with John's wishes.  It was not required for the steward to preface each business transaction with "in John's name"; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney and be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legal and religious definitions of "faith".)  With this cultural background, praying "in Jesus' name" does not mandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the petitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous "fiduciary" relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His Kingdom.  The message of "praying in Jesus' name" is thus closely aligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God's delegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and responsibilities.  This idea of praying "in Jesus' name" is not only present but prominent in the Lord's Prayer, although the verbal forumula is absent.  The act of praying the words "In Jesus' Name" may be beneficial if they cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the advancement of God's Kingdom.  For that reason, I'm not quite ready to say that the praying the formula is without meaning.  Prayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving, etc.) don't seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by Christian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D. (that's B.C.E. or C.E. for you P.C. :-).  I don't see anything in Christ's words to contradict the idea that God deals with all prayers according to His omniscience and grace.

While I wouldn't be too terribly impressed with anybody who got to be paranoid based on either Usenet in general or Phill Hallam-Baker's comments in general, you'd be surprised.          For most people, if you accuse them of something long enough and loud enough, to enough people, they start to ask why they're bothering to fight it.          If nothing you do will be considered right, why bother to do right?

What an amazing thing.  I didn't realize that over a hundred million gun owners all posted to tpg.          Even if *all* the posts in talk.politics.guns illustrated what you say they illustrate, it would still only reflect the written personas (which is often different from face-to-face) of a very, very small and select group.          Anybody who seriously generalizes any attitudes or positions on Usenet to the general population of any country either doesn't care about accuracy or needs to have a few realities explained to them.   >USEnet as a whole >disproves it of humanity as a whole.           Speaking of which...         Most of the "readership" posts I've seen put the most read newsgroups at about 160,000 readers, a number I have a feeling is fairly inflated.  The posters, rare and regular, are themseleves a very tiny minority of that group.  And the whole of Usenet readers are themselves a very distorted sample of humanity.          If anything, the only real thing you can get out of the relative sample of Usenet readers is that we've got too much equipment and too much time available to us.   >We now have proof positive that guns don't make you safer.

Proof that guns don't make you safer is that if you buy one the government will show up and kill you?           Tell me, if the government took away the voting rights of everybody who exercised their free speech, would that then be proof that free speech squelches political activity?           You are equating two things with each other that don't.   >See even in the paranoid mindset of tpg there are good reasons >to support gun control.           Phill, if you really believe that the various posts on computer nets represents *either* most of the poster's in person personalities *or* the general public's general opinions, then I have some serious reservations about your grasp on reality.           But don't expect you really do believe that.  It's simply a convenient way to make your point, and hopefully make those people you don't like look bad.   >Cuddles 'n kisses > >Phill           Have a nice day, Phill.   --------------------------------------------------------------------- David Veal  University of Tennessee Division of Continuing Education PA146008@utkvm1.utk.edu - "I still remember the way you laughed\ When you pushed me down the elevator shaft\ ...

Or in the powerbook in general?  What are the factors that make the Duo 210 so slow compared to a desktop   machine running the same processor at the same speed (25MHz 68030)?  How many   wait states are in the memory system, etc?  What kind of a data bus does it   use?  32-bit or 16-bit?    It's still slow when plugged into a DuoDock.  Anyone know in general what kind of shortcuts notebook manufacturers take when   making notebooks?  I heard of a 486DX2/66 notebook getting a "whopping" 10   MIPS rating.  A similar desktop machine should be getting about 3 times that,   I guess.  -Avery

For example, since Apple never used the Motorola 68008 and  68010 in the Mac these chips are not listed. Years only appear with dead CPUs  and indicate first to last year used as a CPU. Cache note:  both IBM and Mac use caches external to the CPUs. These external  caches increase the speed of the CPU but are not a part of it.  In most of  the present Macs there are external caches built-in while with IBM they are  optional {Though machines are generally sold with them installed}.  Since  there are many different external caches {CPU-Mac and IBM; SCSI, video, disk  and static RAM-Mac}, each having a different effect on CPU performance, and  they are machine {32KB static RAM cache in IIci, IIfx, and IIvx}, seller  {cache card installed in some IIcis} or expansion {IIci cache cards go up to  128KB} dependent, I have decided to leave them out of the list.

As it is now, studies such as one in a Byte article {which showed  040/25 ~486/50 and roughly ~486dx2/50} are very dependent on the machine, OS,  and programs tested and as such are not representative of general performance. *#Motorola claims (PC Week 09/07/92; 09/14/92).

Select venders were sent sample  MC98601 chips by Motorola 2/93 (PC Week 2/08/93), and some NuBus boards  containing early samples of PowerPC 601 have been given to Apple's "A-list"  developers (PC Week 12/7/92; MacWeek 12/14/92).  MC98601/50MHz-$280; MC98601/66MHz-$374 (PC Week 4/12/93).  Systems: ~$3500 with ~$2000 versions out by mid 1994 (PC Week 4/12/93).  CPUs Comparison List As a general rule of thumb Motorola chips are faster than Intel chips at the  same frequency {030/25 ~= 386/33; 040/25 ~= 486dx/50}, but Intel has chips at  higher frequencies than Motorola, so this evens out.  The Macintosh Bible 4th  ed. supports the comparisons between Intel and Motorola chips for the 68020  and above.  <=80186    ~ 68000 {16-bit vs 16/24/32-bit chip [data path/address  lines/data & address registers].  The 4MB limit on the 68000 Macs brings it  down to the 80186 and lower chips, otherwise it would compare to the 80286.}  286        ~ 68020 {hardware segmenting vs. 68020's 32-bit ALU and these chips  come have no usable built-in MMU unlike their successors [80386, 68030].  The  hardware segmenting's protected mode is used by OS/2 1.0 => and Windows 3.X.  The use of the hardware segmenting and their 16-bit nature put the 286 between  the 60000 and 68030 in features and the LC's 16-bit data path strenghthens the  286 ~ 68020 comparison.}  386       ~ 68030 {Two 32-bit chips with MMUs, and protected memory.  A/UX 3.0  is at present the only Mac OS to use the 68030's protected memory feature for  apps.  System 7.x uses this feature to protect a RAM disk created by the  Memory control panel but this is supported only on Powerbooks and Quadras.   The Color Classic and LCII 16-bit hardware data paths makes the 68030s in them  comparative to 386sxs.}  486sx   ~ 68LC040 {same as 486 and 68040 without the FPU; used as a low cost  solution for people who do not need the FPU.

These chips may flounder against the cheaper (PC Week 3/08/93;  4/12/93; PC Mag 4/27/93:110), earlier released (PC Week 12/7/92; MacWeek  12/14/92; PC Week 2/08/93), less leat producing {160 degrees F for Pentium (PC Mag 4/27/93:118)}, and partly ported to PowerPC chips.}   PowerPC   = PowerPC {This CPU line is planned to run programs from DOS,  Windows 3.x, OS/2 and Mac OS on top of PowerOpen-A/UX 4.0 [UNIX] and later  Pink [Taligent OS] by using emulators or, if necessary, the OSes themselves in  a 'shell' a.k. how SoftPC or OS/2 does DOS.}  Hardware  {In an effort to remove the 'reconfiguring the system almost every time you  add something' requirement for add-in cards, drivers, video, and operating  systems in the IBM world, Intel, Microsoft and 12 other hardware and software  developers are working out 'plug and play' standards (PC Week 03/08/93).} Color Support/Display  Mac: 30.24 MHz Pixel Clock standard.  All present Macs support the use of  32-bit color through 32-bit color QuickDraw in ROM.  32-bit color QuickDraw  allows an almost transparent capability to display and edit X-bit images in Y- bit color and retain ALL the colors of Y-bit color [Where X and Y  independently are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32] regardless of monitor resolution {63  dpi [12" color] to 94 dpi [PaletteBook]} or monitor type {including  autosynchronous VGA, MCGA and SVGA monitors with ranges including 66.7 hz  vertically and 35 kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor (MacUser  Aug 1992: 158-176).  Older machines that supported color {SE/30, II, IIX, and  IIcx} had only 8-bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use 32-bit  color (MacUser Special 1993:28-29).   To keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only 8 or 16 bit display  capability built-in, but most of those can be expanded to display 24-bit  color.    Presently QuickDraw is optimized for 72 dpi display; QuickDraw QX  will change this. In addition, QuickDraw allows, in Macs with a NuBus slot, more then one  monitor to be used in any combination, from two monitors showing the same  thing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree  of overlap of the pictures. VRAM: Video RAM.  Standard for present non-PowerBook Mac's handling of   built-in video {from a 32-bit color palette}. VRAM provided runs a 8-bit  color 640x480 display; expandable to 16-bit color or a 8-bit 832x624 display.  Sound output:  Standard in all Macs since the 128K.  Stereo sound became   standard with the SE/30.  IBM:  Even though PCs have ROM BIOS definitions of how the operating system  interacts with the video hardware (Nan Zou), the use of drivers bypassing  BIOS, video hareware inconsitancies {see Super VGA below} and nonstanderzation of clone BIOS have left resolution of video display hardware, OS and program  interaction up to the OS and video hardware in question (Faisal Nameer  Jawdat). In addition, IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a  standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is  actually present (Matt Healy) nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox {like  Mac's QD}. As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes,  especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly {At present  things are so dependent on the interaction of the program, OS, print driver  and monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode, OS,  and monitor type/card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with  an IBM.  For example, one cannot edit a 32-bit color picture done on a OS/2  486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA {18-bit color palette} and DOS 5.0  and still have ALL the colors one started out with}. Later IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators, faster  processors, and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards, CD  ROM, and Ethernet (PC Week 12/14/92).   MDA: Monocrome Display Adapter  original character-mapped video mode, no graphics, 80x25 text. CGA: Color Graphics Array  320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palette, bad for the eyes. EGA:  Enhanced Graphics Array  640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [and some lower res]; some versions   could run at 256 colors, bearable on the eyes. VGA:  Video Graphics Array*  320x200 at 256 colors, 640x480 at 16 colors, and some others, these two are   the most commonly used.  All modes have a 256K CLUT, from a   18 to 24-bit {IBM} or a 32-bit {Mac} color palette.  25.175 MHz Pixel Clock  (Mel Martinez).  Monitors use analog input, incompatible with TTL signals  from EGA/CGA etc.  MCGA:  Multi-Color Graphics Array*  subset of VGA that provides all the features of MDA & CGA, but lacks some EGA   and VGA modes, like VGA 640x480x16 (Dictionary of Computer Terms-DCT).    Common on the initial PS/1 implementation from IBM and some PS/2 Models. SVGA:  Super VGA*  This is not a standard in the way the others were, but instead was a 'catch   all' category for a group of video cards.  As such, with each manufacturer   using their own implementation scheme, SVGA was chaos with people debating  as to what is SVGA and what is not.  In an effort to make SVGA more of a   standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units, but things  are still a mess.  Video is either 512K [~1990] or 1M [today], resolution  of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common, newer ones [since   1990] have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC, giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600,   some of the very newer ones [~6/92] can do 24 bits per pixel [usually   at 640x480].  Speedwise, too much variation, some very slow [Western Digital   Paradise based, for example], some very fast [S3 86C911 based, for example],   some are so-so [like Tseng ET4000, a very popular chipset].  Some limiting   factors overcome by 40MHz VL Bus & 386's linear address mapping were:   8.33 MHz ISA bus, AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a   64K "window", etc. Other non-SVGA standards:  8514/a:  IBM's own standard, interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions   like linedraw, polygon fill, etc. in hardware. Some clone implementations   from ATI are the fastest video available today, though some clone models do   not have interlacing.  TMS34010/34020: high end graphics co-processors, usually >$1000, some  do 24-bit, speeds up vector-oriented graphics like CAD. XGA:  eXtended Graphics Array  newer and faster than 8514/a, only available for MCA bus-based PS/2s, clones   are coming out soon.  Emulates VGA, EGA, and CGA (DCT).  Max resolution at   1024x768x8b, same as 8514/a, also some 16 bpp modes. XGA-2  Accelerates graphics functions up to 20 times faster than standard VGA in  Windows and OS/2, including line draws, bit and pixel-block transfers, area  fills, masking and X/Y addressing. Has an intelligent way to detect and co-  exist with other XGA-2 cards, so multiple desktops like on the Mac may not be   far away.  Since this is an architecture, its resolution and color depth   isn't fixed {IBM implements only 16-bit [65,536] color, while other   companies can have 24-bit color through IBM technical licenses}. Refresh   rates up to 75 Hz, ensures flicker free, rock solid images to reduce visual   discomfort, and is VGA compatible. Up to 1280x1024 on OS/2. *some monitor types usable by Mac-See Mac section above for specific details.  Expansion Both Mac & IBM SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.  Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card   expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.    Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal   terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port   {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the   end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}.  SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}  and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  Difference is due to SCSI-1 software  drivers.  "Fast SCSI-1" is a misname for 8-bit SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode  {see SCSI-2 for details}. SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully  SCSI-1 compliant and 8-bit SCSI-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast  SCSI-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in    hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 do.  Transfer speeds are  4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and  15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 can  use SCSI-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds and as such  is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called "fast SCSI-1".   16-bit fast SCSI-2 requires a SCSI-2 software driver and SCSI-2 electronics  but can still use the SCSI-1 ports.  Wide 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require a  different SCSI port, electronics, and software driver from SCSI-1 {Which  makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}. Mac SCSI: asynchronous SCSI-1 built-in standard since the Plus.  Even though   Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers, the OS SCSI Manager  needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI  interfaces.  As a result present SCSI-2 Macs use 8-bit SCSI-2 as a fast   asynchronous SCSI-1.  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI-2  controller chip built-in (Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1))   though they lack some other parts of the hardware, like the wide SCSI-2 port   interface.  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI-2, older NuBus   Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU.  Rumor-some  Cyclone Macs {June} will come with a wide & fast SCSI-2 port standard   and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager. IBM SCSI:  SCSI-1 is not too wide spread yet, generally not bundled with   systems, except as add-on {EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable}.  Like the Mac, 8-bit SCSI-2 is used as a very fast SCSI-1 by most controllers  out there.  Unlike the Mac, IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications  which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI.  Mac Memory expansion: with a few exceptions the Mac has used non-parity 30-pin   8-bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus.  While 32-pin 9-bit parity SIMMs  could be used in these Macs, only special IIcis could make use of the parity   feature {By convension both SIMM types are called 32-pin SIMMs}.  The IIfx   used 64-pin parity SIMMs.  The LC III, C610/650 and Q800 all use a new   72-pin SIMM that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in IBMs.  The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every  memory location; if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will  not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is.  Since Macs made before Feb 15, 1993 managed memory baced on data path, SIMMs   had to be installed in pairs {16-bit} or in sets of 4 {32-bit}.  The Centris   650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that   allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time.  If the SIMMs are the same   size are used then the memory is 'interleaved' across the two SIMMs resulting   in a 10-15% performance boost on RAM access (MacWorld Apr 93: 108-109). Printers, ADBs, and modems: built-in interfaces standard. Monitor interface and sound input: built-in on most present macs.  PDS: Available in SE & all present non-Powerbook Macs. 16-bit {SE,   Portable, LC, LC II, Classic line} and 32-bit.  Operates at CPU's MHz.    Maximum through put: data path in bytes*CPU's MHz {Q700/900 & C650:   4 * 25Mhz = 100MB/s; Q800 & Q950: 4 * 33Mhz = 132MB/s}. Standardized with  the LC and 040 bus designs.  With an adapter one NuBus card can be used in   IIsi and C610.  Problem: some cards have timing dependency which slows   through put down. NuBus Mac II: 32-bit, 10 MHz bus clock, 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio,  and contiguous, hand-shake transactions at ~10-20MB/s; theoretical peak:  40MB/s.  Built-in on all Modular Macs except the LC series, C610, and   Performa 400.  The SE/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a   Mac Plus SCSI NuBus.  Supports every possible expansion from CPU to Ethernet   to DMA. NuBus 90: NuBus Mac II back compatable. 20MHz bus clock, avg throughput:  ~30MB/s; burst mode: 80MB/s.  Future card designs will be 7" instead of the   old 12". QuickRing:  A peer-to-peer bus used in parallel with NuBus 90.  Apple's   VLBus - "Architecture is identical to that of VLBus" (Byte 10/92:128).  Burst mode: 350MB/s (Byte 10/92:128). In development. CPU expansion: handled either through the PDS or the NuBus.  Unlike PDS,    Nubus CPU cards {example-Radius Rocket} allow use of multiple processors at   the same time.  This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to   dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved {Each   NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with   8MB RAM SIMMs on the card standard}.  IBM Memory expansion:  parity SIMMs, non-parity SIMMs {some newer models do a Mac- like SIMM memory check}, or a dozen or so different types of memory boards.  HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}:  MFM:  Modified Frequency Modulation, RLL:  Run Length Limited  only used with smaller [60mb] hard drives. IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics   Asynchronous {~5MB/s max} and synchronous {8.3MB/s max} transfer.  currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized   drives. Can have more than one hard drive.  ESDI:  Enhanced Small Device Interface  ~1.25MB/s throughput. generally considered better interface than SCSI-1 in  many ways but not common enough for practical consideration.  Outside of  hard drives, device choices are very limited compared to SCSI-1.   BUS interfaces {New 'plug and play' ISA and EISA compatable cards may have problems working  with old cards (InfoWorld; PC Week 03/08/93; Vaporware 4/93).} ISA  8 & 16-bit interfaces common. Has 24-bit data path limit {which produces a  16MB limit for which there are software workarounds} (PC Mag 4/27/93:105).  1.5 MB/s (Byte 3/93:132).  Uses edge-triggered interrupts, can't share them,  hence comes the IRQ conflict.  Limited busmastering capabilities, some cards  aren't bandwidth limited {COM  ports, LPT ports, game ports, MIDI card, etc.}  while others are {video and disk controllers}.  Dominant factor, but it's  showing its age.  Most ISA motherboard designs are 16-bit  (PC World Feb 1993: 144-5)}.   MCA {Micro Channel}  IBM's 16 and 32-bit bus; "allows use of more than one CPU in a computer"   (DCT) and anything can talk to anything, as fast as the two components   involved can handle it. Never took off because it was incompatible with ISA   and EISA.  Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC 601 (Carl Jabido). EISA {NuBus Mac II is closest Mac equivalent}  32-bit, 8.33 MHz, burst mode: 33MB/s.  It also has the ability to   self-configure cards like MCA and allows multiple bus masters, sharable   interrupt and DMA channels and multiple CPU use. VESA Local Bus: VLB {Sometimes mistakenly refereed to as PDS}  Local Bus standard. Runs at CPU clock rate,  Burst modes: ~130 MB/s{32-bit}  250 MB/s{64-bit} (Byte 10/92:128).  Limited to three slots but allows bus   mastering and will coexist with either ISA or EISA. Consitered ideal for   video and disk I/O.  DELL has filled a claim that this violates one of  their patents (Mel Martinez). QuickRing: Apple's faster {350 MB/s burst} version of VLB architecture  (Byte 10/92:132).  Might show up in some IBM and PowerPC machines  (Byte 10/92:132-133). In development. PCI  Intel's version of Local Bus that is intended to totally replace   ISA/EISA/MCA.  In development.  OSes {assumes full installation [print drivers, fonts, Multifinder, etc.] and multiple application use.} Mac 512K to 1MB of OS and hardware commands have been put into ROM.  This allows  Apple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the Mac OS {QuickDraw,  menu commands, print, mouse, SCSI & sound drivers, etc} in ROM, which require  clone makers to use the ROM chip or read ROM on to disks {Which requires  access to the proper Mac since different Macs have slightly different ROM  chips; Plus vs Classic for example.}  With key hooks for the OS support  interface in ROM, programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk OS  has the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and  therefore can write smaller programs.  This also allows Apple greater control  over hardware-software standards and that the disk OS can be smaller and, with  some of the tookbox command code in ROM, with lower RAM requirements then a  totally disk based OS.  Macs use Masked ROM which is as fast as DRAM (Jon  Wtte). 6.0.7: Single program usage base requirements: 1 MB and DD floppy,   cooperatively-multitasking base requirements: 2MB and HD floppy.    Features a GUI, cooperative-multitasker [MultiFinder], standard program   interface, & standard stereo sound support [snd]. Network receiving part of   AppleShare software is bundled with the OS. Has a 8MB RAM barrier and is a   24-bit OS. Some third party products allow 14MB of Virtual Memory as long as   real RAM is below 8MB. 6.0.8: 6.0.7 with 7.0.0 print drivers. 6.0.8L:  System 6 for some Macs that require System 7.0.X. 7.0.X: Base requirements: 2MB, 40MB Hard Drive, and 68000; De-facto standard   to run all features well: 4MB, 80MB Hard Drive, and 68030 {lowest present   non-portable Mac configuration}.  Using up to 10.08MB {This is EVERYTHING on  system disks} of hard disk space this has 6.0.7 features plus program linking   within and between computers [IAC], built-in server capabilities {Filesharing   can be used by older OSes using AppleShare Client software and can be   accessed by 10 macs max; 4-5 is more speed practical, IAC requires 7.X},   Virtual Memory in machines with MMU{1.6 times real RAM for least noticeable   IIsi speed degradation}, drag and drop, QuickTime & built-in TrueType   support.  Supports sound input [AIFF and snd formats] for most present   machines.  Can access up to 1GB of true RAM and 4GB of virtual memory and is   both a 24 and 32-bit OS.  To use real RAM beyond 8MB it must be in 32-bit   mode and on older machines requires the 'Mode 32' extension.  Apple's last   'free' OS. 7.1.0: 7.0.1 with WorldScript support, speedier, and less RAM usage than   7.0.dot (MacWeek 8/24/92; 9/14/92; PC Week 9/7/92). To run in 32-bit mode   on older machines it requires the 'Mode 32' or '32-Bit Enabler' extension.   Marks the start of Apple saling its Mac OS instead of allowing free upgrades  {Bundled with new machines, $49 for 7.0.X upgrades, $99 otherwise}.  [The installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system   fonts from the previous system inside the system file.  This can eat up any   RAM benefits and cause other problems.  Apple itself recommends removing all   fonts from the system file.] A/UX 3.0 [UNIX]: Needs 8MB RAM {12-20MB suggested}, 160MB hard drive, and   a 68030 or 68040 equivalent to run.  This 32-bit preemptive multitasking OS   is large due to being UNIX and needing translators between it and the Mac   ROMs.  Price: $709. Note: sound output was supported in OSes 3.2 to 6.0.5 by many formats  including the following:  snd, WAVE, ASND, FSSD, QSSN, SMSD, SOUN, dc2d, and  DCFL.  In 6.0.7 the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards 'snd'  and AIFF which causes some playback problems for the old formats, though most  still play.  IBM  Machiness have little GUI code, data, and hooks present in hardware for  programmers to work with, so most of the coding must be provided in the OS.   Since hard disks were slow the disk OS code is read into RAM.  In addition,  what little ROM code there is also read into RAM {a process called Shadow ROM}   This results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or  EPROMS.  Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to  better optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which  is harder with a ROM based system due to the 'patches' needed.  In addition it  reduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware  support is needed. Side note:  The FTC charged that MicroSoft formed a OS trust by not providing  all feature documentation for its OSes to developers outside MS and designing  its Windows and DOS apps to fail under OS/2 ("Undocumented Windows") and  "There is deliberate code in [Windows] NT Beta which causes the install to  abort if OS/2 Boot Manager is present" (Gregory Hicks, Info-IBMPC Digest V92  #201).  Due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the FTC  judicial council for action against Microsoft was a tie which resulted in no  action.  Rumors-the FTC will presue the matter, likely to the point of  choosing a new member or whole new council.  In addition the government has  turned down Microsoft's copyright of "Windows" which would allow it to charge  a fee for developers using their hooks (PC Week 03/08/93). MicroSoft OSes DOS 5.0: Has a 640K barrier with its own memory manager, a 1 MB barrier   with third party memory managers.  This 16-bit OS requires that each program   must provide its own print drivers and be 16-bit {Programs need to be DOS   Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) compliant and running on a 386dx [32-bit   Protected Mode] to break these barriers}.  Contains the GUI shell present in  DOS 4.0. DOS 6.0: DOS 5.0 with the added features of a built-in file compresion, disk   defragmenter, debugger for the CONFIG.SYS file. It needs a $80 module for   networking {Cost: $50 through 5/93, after that $129.99}   (Byte April 1993:44-46). DOS 7.0: 32-bit DOS. In development (PC Week 04/05/93). Window 3.0: Runs on top of DOS.  Breaks 640K and 1M barriers but still has to   deal with DOS file structure.  Base requirements: 1MB, floppy and 286; to  run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx and fast display adapter {> 8-bit}.  Has the  equivalent of Mac's QD called Windows GDI [Graphics Device Interface].  This does not have a consistent application interface {Like early Mac  programs  (1984-1985)} nor a very large program base {compared to DOS} and  still tends to slow the machine down (Info-IBMPC Digest V92 #186) with speed  is more dependent on the display adapter then on the CPU (Bill Coleman).  Window programs tend to be disk and memory hogs compared to their DOS  counterparts (Byte April 1993:98-108). Window 3.1: A faster version of Window 3.0 with better memory managment. Base   requirements 1 MB, hard drive and a 286 ;to run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx.   Apple plans to release its print drivers for this (PC Week 12/28/92). Windows for Workgroups:  To run well: 4MB RAM and 386dx (PC World Feb/93:160).    Intermediary between Win 3.1 and Windows NT.  It is basically Windows 3.1   with built-in peer to peer networking support. Windows NT:  Beta release takes about 50MB of disk space [including the   swap file], and 12MB RAM {Betas are notorious for RAM usage especially in   the interaction between debuging code and program compliers, hence the   reports of 24MB requirements}.  Released version supposed to need 8MB RAM   but, Gates himself now recommends 16MB RAM (PC Week 04/15/92).  This 32-bit OS has Protected mode multitasking, multithreading, symmetric   multiprocessing, a recoverable file system, and 32-bit GDI.  Has built in  networking that is OSF DCE compliant and can handle up to 4GB of RAM.  Even  though some people see a July 4 release date (InfoWorld Nov 16/92), rumor  is that the final version will not be available before Oct 1993  (InfoWorld May 25/92; July 6/92; Vaporware 07/92; 08/92) or 4th quarter 1993  (PC Week 09/28/92). Windows upgrades will be $295, otherwise $495  (PC Week 04/15/92; 03/15/93). Other OSes PC-DOS 6.0: IBM's version of DOS 6.0.  It runs Windows much faster then DOS   6.0 due to faster file I/O and video handling (InfoWorld Feb 1, 93). DR DOS 6.0: same as DOS 5.0 with some extras {like built-in data compression}   and memory management enhancements. Still has 640K/1MB barrier.  A later   version {Novell DOS} of this may use a version of the Mac finder and Apple   file management system (PC Week 12/14/92; InfoWorld Dec 14/92). OS/2 2.0: Unix like features and unix like requirements; 8-16MB RAM,  60MB {uses 17-33MB} hard drive, and 386dx CPU. This 32-bit multithreaded,   multitasking OS can address up to 4GB of RAM but has to use a fast swap file   to use more than 16 MB RAM on ISA systems using DMA {Direct Memory Access}.   IBM plans to use Taligent's OOPS in future versions of this   (InfoWorld Oct 26/92). AIX:  IBM's UNIX system, planned to be a subset of PowerOpen and Taligent OS. NeXTStep: GUI UNIX to provide NeXT features on IBM machines.  Beta out, final   version to be out by May 25, 1993. Solaris OS for x86: a SunSoft port.  A 32-bit OS with symmetric   multiprocessing and multithreading, built-in networking capabilities with   tools to allow remote configuring and adminstration features, and   communication package.  Client: $795,  50 users server: $1,995, 1000s users  server: $5,995.  Developer kits-software: $495, hardware: $195. Mac 7.1 [working name: Star Trek]:  Apple had System 7.0 running off Intel   Chips and is looking at making a 7.1 version available for IBM   (ComputerWorld Nov 2/92; MacWeek 03/22/93). At present this is planned to run   on top of Novell's DR DOS, require a 486 or equivalent to run and that apps   will need to be recompiled (MacWeek 03/22/93).  Viewed as Novell's answer to   Windows NT.  The complexity of PC hardware set ups is one reason for slow   progress {This seems to Apple/IBM's way of leading to the PowerPC line out in   late 1993/early 1994 and Pink OS in late 1994-early 1995.}  PowerPC Rumor-IBM will build its PowerPC 601 by late 1993 (InfoWorld June 8 & 15, 92;  MacWeek 7/13/92; PC Week 3/15/93).  It will have MicroChannel bus and XGA  video (Carl B Jabido), and will run native version AIX and Mac apps (PC Week  3/15/93); there have been no comments on compatablity of DOS or Windows apps. Apple's PowerPC 601 machine {Tesseract} is planned to be out Jan 24, 1994 and  to have MC98601/50 MHz, 4/8MB RAM, a 2.8-Mbyte floppy drive and expected to  sale near LC line prices {~$2000, down from projections of ~$3000 (MacUser  9/92:146)} (MacWeek 3/22/93). PowerOpen [A/UX 4.0]: A 32-bit preemtive multitasking OS planned to run on  PowerPCs and 68030/40 Macs (MacWeek 7/13/92).  Intel compatibility uncertain  (See Mac 7.1 above).  Planned base requirements:  68030, 8MB RAM, 80MB hard  drive (MacWeek 4/19/93). Rumor-ahead of schedule; COULD be out by mid 1993.  Rumor-this could be the OS for IBM's PowerPC 601 which is due by late 1993. Pink [Taligent OS]: Expecting delivery in 1994 (Wall Street Journal 1/12/92)   and may have some parts shipping in OS/2 and AIX in 1993 and Mac OS and   PowerOpen with the PowerPCs (MacWeek 01/25/93). Windows NT: Possible port (MacWeek 04/05/93).  See IBM OS section for details. Solaris OS: Version of this Sun Microsystems Inc UNIX OS to run on the  Power PCs in 1994 (MacWeek 04/05/93).  One of the few OSes to directly state   that it will run Windows/DOS programs.  IBM OS section for details NeXTStep: possible port see IBM OS section for details.  OS Number Crunching (Mel Park) Mac  Arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment {SANE or Standard  Apple Numerics Environment}. Floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an  FPU is present and 80 bits otherwise. Exceptions, such as dividing by zero or  taking the square root of a negative number, do not cause an abort but are  handled in a logically consistent manner. 1/0 produces the internal  representation for infinity (INF).  1/(1/0) produces zero. The above treatment  of 1/(1/0) occurs in an FPU-equipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and  the FPU programmed directly.  IBM  Floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware FPU, 64-bits when  emulated.  The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever  compiler or assembler was used for a program. On older DOS complilers  exceptions could cause program aborts; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the DOS  prompt at the point where they occured.  Most present compilers handle this  better.  Result: there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS,  Windows and OS/2 programs nor between programs for just one OS.  Networking [Includes printing] WYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially  if one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer. Mac Hardware: Built-in LocalTalk network port and a built-in printer port.   LocalTalk has moderate speeds (230.4 Kb/s) requires special connectors for  each machine ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to  include very old macs} or the network port {standard today}.  Built-in  Ethernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at  about $150-$300 for each machine.  These cards provide three connectors and  transceivers {thick, thin, and 10BaseT} for Ethernet. The Macintosh Quadra family and some Centris models includes Ethernet  interface on motherboard, with transceivers available. TokenRing has been a  network option since 1989. Software: AppleTalk {the suite of protocols} standard with Mac OS, which can  use variety of media types.  AppleShare client software included with the OS  as well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware, 3Com 3+Open,  Banyan Vines, DEC Pathworks, Apple's AppleShare servers, System 7 File Sharing  machines, and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts.  MacTCP allows  typical TCP/IP communications (telnet, ftp, NFS, rlogin).  A later version  will have Unix X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) built-in by the end of 1993  (MacWeek 04/12/93).  Third-party software to connect to NFS servers.  DEC  Pathworks provides DECnet support.  Peer-to-peer file sharing software  built-in to System 7.1 (See OS section).  Full server software is extra.  Printing requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in  the chooser.  Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the  chooser.  The same is true of connecting to servers. Printing bugs:  Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font.  {QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems.}  IBM   Hardware: LocalTalk [not widely used], Ethernet,  and TokenRing. Software: Novell Netware, Banyan Vines, DECNet, Windows/Work Groups, AppleTalk  protocols, and AppleShare {subset of AppleTalk}. Each of the MS-DOS networking schemes are, in general, totally incompatible  with the others. Once you have chosen one, you are pretty much locked-in to  that product line from then on.  Windows/Work Groups is a little more  forgiving and removes some of this problem.  Novell Netware is the biggest,  {~80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and  offers better control/management/security than AppleShare, but it's also more  complex to set up and manage.  This will change due to the use of the Mac  finder and file management system by Novell. (PC Week 12/14/92 & 12/28/92;   InfoWorld Dec 14/92; MacWeek 3/22/93) Printing {Very OS dependent} DOS: If it's a single user, then you plug the printer into the parallel port,   and don't worry about it {Tweeking may be needed with poorly written   software}.  Network Printing is not controlled by the system, but is mostly   implemented by the actual program, therefore performance varies from one   software program to the next. Windows 3.x: supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing "jobs"   in the print queue, but it always lists printers as "active"... even if they   are not.  This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers   on the same net, because there's no way for software to reliably determine   which printer is active right now.  Windows for Workgroups is more Mac-like   and intelligent about this. OS/2: Mac-like; the os deals with printers, with apps making calls to the OS. Printing bugs: due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do  not have WYSIWYG printing.  This is the fault of the programs in question and  not that of the OS involved.  Price issue: This is very dynamic with Mac providing more build-in features  than IBM and IBM being more 'get only what you need' then Mac and price wars  by both worlds. The IBM machines' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware  standarization, which in turn requires OSes and programs to be very complex to  handle ALL the variation in hardware.  When one adds all the standard Mac  hardware features to an IBM {built-in input/output sound support, SCSI, PDS,   built-in monitor support, built-in networking, standard mouse interface, and  NuBus 90 in higher machines} the Mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent  equipted IBM machine {Especially since some IBM monitors can be used with Macs  which cuts some more of the Mac's cost (MacUser Aug 1992:158-176)}.  Some prices using some of the info in this sheet and MacUser April 1993. All Macs below come with a PDS slot, VRAM, and SCSI-1 built in.  Except where  noted, monitor is extra and a built-in monitor interface is provided {no card  needed except for 24-bit color display}. IBM planned a $1,200 386SLC/25MHz model with a 60MB hard drive and color VGA  monitor {~VRAM} (MacWeek 8/17/92) {sounds like a Color Classic without SCSI-1,  sound support, built-in network support, FPU socket, built-in expansion to  16-bit color, etc}. Color Classic:  $1,389 - 030/16MHz with 16-bit data bus {~386sx/20MHz  equivalent}, 4/80, FPU socket, and built-in monitor. LCIII: $1,499 - 030/25MHz {~386dx/33MHz equivalent}, and 4/160. Centris 610: $2,899 - 68LC040/20MHz {Depending on the program ~486sx/40 or  ~'486dx2sx'/20[40]MHz equivalent}, 8/230, built-in ethernet, 300i CD-ROM, a  PDS/NuBus 90 slot and VRAM for 16-bit color. Centris 650: 040/25MHz {Depending on the program ~486dx/50 MHz or 486dx2/50  MHz equivalent} with a PDS and 3 NuBus 90 slots. $3,189 {ethernet, 8/80};  $3,559 {ethernet, 8/230}; $3,999 {ethernet, 8/230, CD-ROM, VRAM for 16-bit  color}  Bibliography notes 'Vaporware' is available in the digest/vapor directory by FTP on sumex- aim.stanford.edu [36.44.0.6] and was by Murphy Sewall {last issue: April 93.} 'Info-IBMPC Digest' back issues are available from wsmr-simtel20.army.mil in  directory PD2:<ARCHIVES.IBMPC> 'Dictionary of Computer Terms 3rd ed.'

Following the Greek  Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with the aid of the Greek  army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right given by two international  agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently and conveniently forgotten  people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For those Turkish Cypriots whose  grandparents have been living on the island since 1571. And the next is 'Karabag'.  The people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek  Cypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will  remain eternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever  the cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece  was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July 15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop Makarios.  The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the 'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences  for this irresponsible conduct.               THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM  2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, Cyprus  It is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving at the Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched against the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat Ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally killed in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage Greeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the 24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which has been converted into a museum.  AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY GREEK TERRORISTS  The date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the Greeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been going on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men and children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal Area of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage bloodshed...  The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent, are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the bathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their home. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.  Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by Mr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded during the same terrible event.  "On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan. Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs. Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting having supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River direction started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain. Thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was dangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought would be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We waited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing in the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her arms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open. Greeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house with  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard voices saying, in  Greek, "You want Taksim eh!"  and then bullets started flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children fell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks, who broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I heard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.  When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and her three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what had happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to the  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was brutally murdered.  In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying "Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?"  I became terrified. I thought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not dead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself under the double-bed.  An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My mouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some water. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the bathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I offered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who were all wounded.  We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I thought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed to be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber and I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked as far as Koshklu Chiftlik.  There, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were operated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs. Ayshe and her daughter.  After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to Ankara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months treatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus, Greeks arrested me at the Airport.  All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my detention. They then released me."  ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER  We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in which 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five days.  We  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some terrible sights.  In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A child's bicycle lay in a corner.  In the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three children piled on top of their murdered mother.  In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the head.  This, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose family had been killed by the mob in the first violence.  Today was five days later, and still they lay there.  Rene MacCOLL and Daniel McGEACHIE, (From the "DAILY EXPRESS")  "...I saw in  a bathroom the bodies of a  mother and three infant children murdered because their father was a Turkish Officer..."  Max CLOS, LE FIGARO 25-26 January, 1964  Serdar Argic                             'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                              might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                              and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

As I mentioned in the Tradition # cited above, for example, it was sufficient in the absence of a theory # about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the "evil" # which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as "satanic."       Which begs the question: if Satan in this case is      metaphorical, how can you be certain Allah is not      the same way?  # The bottom line here, however, is that describing a spiritual plane # in human language is something like describing "color" to a person # who has been blind from birth.

[some deleted for space saving]  # When language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe # another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers, then # such conventions as metaphor, allegory, and the like come to be # necessary.  The "unseen" is described in terms which have reference` # and meaning for the reader/listener.  But, like all models, a compro- # mise must be made when speaking metaphorically: clarity and directness # of meaning, equivalence of perception, and the like are all # crippled.  But what else can you do?       This is why I asked the above.  How would you then      know God exists as a spirit or being rather than      just being metaphorical?  I mean, it's okay to say      "well, Satan is just metaphorical," but then you      have to justify this belief AND justify that God is      not some metaphor for something else.       I say this because there are many, many instances of      Satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in       the Old Testament book of Job, or the temptor in the      New Testament Gospels).  In the same way, God too is      described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know      one is metaphorical and not the other.       Further, belief in God isn't a bar to evil.  Let's      consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were      metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe      in God to justify this belief.  Again, we have a       case where someone does believe in God, but by      religious standards, they are "evil."  If Bobby      does see this, let him address this question also.

My thought, Airline pilots lately have been complaining about how laptops being used in flight mess with the plane's instruments.  If this can be hyped up, manufacturers may start building laptops with even lower emmisions.

Well, GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format and was put forth by Compuserve back in 1987(?) or so.  It was to create a format that could be read and displayed by any system.  GIF is limited to 8 bit color but has a built in compression scheme (LZW?).  IFF is not really a graphics format, but rather a standard way to package images, sounds, animations, text, or whatever into one file.  IFF was created by Electronic Arts, I do believe (I could be wrong), for the Amiga. It was quickly adopted as pretty much the standard file format for the Amiga. The most common image format for the IFF package is an ILBM (InterLeaved BitMap?) but many others exist.  This format supports 24 bit color images.  Information on both of these and many more are available via anonymous ftp at zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in the directory /pub/graphics.formats (Taken from the FAQ for this news group.)  :)  Wayne Rigby rigby@cs.unr.edu

The engine >compartment looks really tight to work on, but it is in fine shape and >I am quite interested in it.  That would be the Opel GT, sold in this country from '69 to '73.  It originally had a 1100 cc engine, which was later replaced by the 1900 cc.  It was based on the old Kadett drive train and suspension, with leaf springs in the rear and a single transverse leaf spring in the front.  It looked good, but was limited as a performer.  There has also been some discussion in this thread about the Manta and other models.  In 1971 Opel introduced a new line of models, the 1900 series, that were also known as model numbers 51, 57, etc.  These cars had the newer 1900cc engine and were available as two and four-door coupes, a station wagon, and a "sport coupe", known in Europe as the Manta.  At the same time, there were two 30-series cars, which sold very few numbers, that also had the 1900 engine but the Kadett suspension.  The sport coupe, (model 57) was also available as the Rallye, (57R), with a blacked out hood, tach, and fog lights, but was mechanically the same except for a numerically higher rear end ratio.  In 1973 the sport coupe was also named the Manta in the US.  1973 was the last year for the GT in any country, both because of the US bumper height regulations and the fact that FIAT exercised an option on the factory that Opel was leasing to build the GTs.  The 1900 series continued in 1974 with minor body differences.  In 1975, the Manta, 1900 sedan (also called the Ascona) and the wagon were available with Bosch electronic fuel injection.  These cars also had larger brakes and wider wheels.  These cars were starting to compete with the 1975 Buick Century low price leader of the time, and were the last Opels imported into the US.  From 1976 to 1979, cars that sported Buick/Opel badges were still sold by the Buick dealers, but were rebadged Isuzu I-marks.  The idea was to call them Opels instead of changing the dealers' neon signs.  Various models of the 50-series cars dominated the Showroom Stock racing of the 70's in their class, and were known as serious 2002-competition.  Parts are still available from a number of sources.  (I still have a '73 manta and two '75 sedans and all the trick parts I could collect in 20 years). --  John Kennedy                     uunet!opel!johnk Second Source, Inc.              johnk@secondsource.COM  Annapolis, MD

I have personally know quite of few of the Wycliffe Bible Translators. As an organization their fundamental purpose is to translate the scriptures into the native languages which in terms usual means learning it and  developing a written language (along with teaching the natives to read). It is not associated with the U.S. govt. at all.  Many governments want the help of the translators.  To the best of my knowledge the  Mexican government now encourages them to come.  Their idea is not cultural interference but the presentation of the Good News.  To understand more about what they do, I suggest you read some of the books (autobiographical and biographical) about some of the translators.  One that stands out in my mind as an excellent is called "Peace Child." This would give a true picture of what their mission is.  >  My concern is that this group may be seen as acceptable and even >praiseworthy by readers of soc.religion.christian.

That would be the same as taking  Suddan's discussion about the CIA, etc. as being true.  We must look at both sides.  Cathy Bareiss

I'd assume easier, >since we're removing particulate matter instead of converting >gasses.  Let's hear people's opinions...  The technology Cummins is applying to diesels to comply with the newer Ca. emissions laws involves three things I know of:  1. All compliant diesels are turbocharged. 2. All use an "aftercooler", which cools the air which was heated    by compression by the turbocharger (up to about 25 PSI). 3. A gismo on the injector pump which senses the pressurized air    intake, and limits full delivery of fuel while the pressure is    low.  No scrubbers, catalytic converters, etc, are used.  The path from the turbocharger to the exhaust outlet is kept very free.  Interestingly, except for the low-pressure fuel limitation, power output  and mileage are enhanced by these measures.  One can buy aftermarket turbos and aftercoolers which generate more power, lots more power, and these are approved by the CARB.  Dan Hepner

I now think it more like a pulse of "relaxation" or comfort than a pulse of electricity.  It is what you feel if you are overwhelmed by a feeling of comfort, such as seeing or thinking about something beautiful.       Another thing.  When you sleep, you lie down facing up, with your palms aside of you and facing down on the surface of the bed.  Then you relax, and there start involuntary nerve firings inside your flesh.  So, you feel a "shiver" below the surface of the skin (not heart-beat). Then this shiver increases, and comes up to your head, and the roam you hear loudens.  (Note that you always hear a high-pitch when you lie down in bed; this is just the noise of your blood running in your ear.)  This roam is different from the high pitch, but follows the shiver of your body.       "Shiver" is not the word.  It may be called a mild vibration or quake. What is this shiver and roam?  Can I use this to induce out-of-body experience?  					Daniel Chung (Mr.), U.S.A.

GANDLER) writes: > >	How does the radio Electronics free information cards work. >Do they just send you some general information about the companies that >advertise in their magazine or does it also give you sign you up for a >catalog.   That depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled. Radio Electronics compiles all of the cards, then each advertiser gets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers who circled their number. Some magazines also provide the data on self-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the data on computer disk.  The advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will notice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called a "bingo card" in the industry) includes lines for a company name and a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national advertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as best they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company and include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably send you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer call you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they will send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail outlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th e whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have nothing to mail out accept the catalog.  A couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry magazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They use the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read the magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push you, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile how many people requested which data for their marketing demographics. This way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that "23% of readers requesting data were interested in capacitors." And finally, some magazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For example, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information about test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC's, in the past 6 months.  The other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines include how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the advertiser can attempt to cull out the "literature collectors" from the serious potential customers.  "Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could."  What's the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?    Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more   than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of   weeks later.    If you are really, really serious and you really, really want   the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also   cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually   everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data   on a computer printout.    To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you're   not really "qualified" for, send in a bingo card at least every   other month and circle two or three numbers.    Include a business name and phone number, even if it's your house.   Advertisers almost never call.

I always like your kind of odds. The Greek governments must be held  to account for the sub-human conditions of the Turkish minority living  in the Western Thrace under the brutal Greek domination. The religious  persecution, cultural oppression and economical ex-communication applied  to the Turkish population in that area are the dimensions of the human  rights abuse widespread in Greece.  "Greece's Housing Policies Worry Western Thrace Turks"  ...Newly built houses belonging to members of the minority community in Dedeagac province, had, he said, been destroyed by Evros province public works department on Dec. 4.  Sungar added that they had received harsh treatment by the security forces during the demolition.  "This is not the first demolition in Dedeagac province; more than 40 houses were destroyed there between 1979-1984 and  members of that minority community were made homeless," he continued.

In his 65-page confession, Salman Demirok, a former chief of PKK operations in Hakkari confessed that high-level relations between PKK, Greece and Greek Cypriot administration existed.  According to Demirok, Greek Cypriot administration not only  gives shelter to PKK guerillas but also supplies them with  food and weapons at the temporary camps set up in its territory.  Demirok disclosed that PKK has three safe houses in South Cyprus,  used by terrorists such as Ferhat. In the camps, he added,  terrorists were trained to use various weapons including RPG's  and anti-aircraft guns which had been purchased directly from  the Greek government. Greek Cypriot government has gone to the  extent of issuing special identification cards to PKK members so  that they can travel from one region to another without being  confronted by legal obstacles. Demirok's account was confirmed  by another PKK defector, Fatih Tan, who gave himself over to  police in Hakkari after spending four years with PKK. Tan explained that the terrorists went through a training in camps in South Cyprus,  sometimes for a period of 12 weeks or more.

"Abu Nidal's Advisers" Reportedly Training                   "PKK & ASALA Militants" in Cyprus         Nicosia, Ankara,  Tel Aviv. The Israeli  secret service,        Mossad,  is   reported  to  have   acquired  significant        information in connection  with the camps set  up in the        Troodos  mountains   in  Cyprus  for  the   training  of        militants of the PKK and ASALA {Armenian Secret Army for        the Liberation  of Armenia}. According to  sources close        to Mossad, about 700 Kurdish, Greek Cypriot and Armenian        militants  are   undergoing  training  in   the  Troodos        mountains in  southern Cyprus.  The same  sources stated        that Abu  Nidal's special  advisers are  giving military        training to  the PKK and  ASALA militants in  the camps.        They added that the  militants leave southern Cyprus for        Libya, Lebanon, Syria, Greece  and Iran after completing        their training.  Mossad has established that  due to the        clashes  which were  taking  place  among the  terrorist        groups based  in Syria, the PKK  and ASALA organisations        moved to  the Greek Cypriot  part of Cyprus,  where they        would  be  more  comfortable. They  also  transferred  a        number of  their camps in  northern Syria to the Troodos        mountains.         Mossad  revealed that  the  Armenian National  Movement,        which is known as the MNA, has opened liaison offices in        Nicosia, Athens and  Tripoli in order to  meet the needs        of the  camps. The offices are used to provide  material        support for the  Armenian  camps. Meanwhile, the  leader        of the  Popular Front for  the Liberation of  Palestine,        George  Habash, is  reported  to  have ordered  his  men        not  to   participate  in  the  operations  carried  out        by  the  PKK &  ASALA, which  he  described  as "extreme        racist,  extreme  nationalist  and   fascist."  Reliable        sources have said that  Habash believed that  the recent        operations carried  out by the PKK  militants  show that        organisation  to  be a  band  of  irregulars  engaged in        extreme  nationalist  operations.  They  added  that  he        instructed  his militants  to sever their links with the        PKK  and avoid clashing with it. It has been established        that George Habash  expelled ASALA  militants  from  his        camp  after ASALA's  connections  with  drug trafficking        were exposed.

Special to The New York Times  ATHENS, June 26 - A dispute developed today between Athens and  Washington over United States intelligence reports saying that  Athens, for several months, conducted negotiations with the terrorist known as Abu Nidal...  They said the contacts were verified in what were termed hard intelligence reports.  Abu Nidal leads the Palestinian splinter group Al Fatah  Revolutionary Council, implicated in the 1985 airport  bombings at Rome and Vienna that contributed to the Reagan  Administration's decision to bomb Tripoli, Libya, last year.  In Washington, State Department officials said that when Administration officials learned about the contacts, the State Department drafted a strongly worded demarche. The officials also expressed unhappiness with Greece's dealings with ASALA, the Armenian Liberation Army, which has carried out terrorist acts against Turks....

The user can choose a new session key K_P for each phone call P he makes. Chip C knows three keys: G, its own U_C, and the user's K_P. The government as a whole knows G and every U_C. Apparently a message M is encrypted as E_G(E_{U_C}(K_P),C) , E_{K_P}(M). That's it.  The system as described here can't possibly work. What happens when someone plugs the above ciphertext into a receiving chip? To get M the receiving chip needs K_P; to get K_P the receiving chip needs U_C. The only information it can work with is C. If U_C can be computed from C then the system is cryptographically useless and the ``key escrow'' is bullshit. Otherwise how is a message decrypted?  ---Dan

I would like to understand how an atheist can object to war (an excellent means of controlling population growth), or to capital punishment, I'm sorry but the logic escapes me. And why just capital punishment, what is being questioned here, the propriety of killing or of punishment? What is the basis of the ecomplaint?  Bill

Back in high school I used to work for a detailing company, and one of the services we offered was an engine cleaning (remove all that oil BEFORE you sell the car...  ;-}). Unfortunately, we did not have a high pressure washer so we would use one several miles from the shop. On more than one occasion after washing the engine, it would not start as water would have gotten under the distributor (I would put a plastic bag around it to try and minimize this), around the spark plug wires, etc and it would be nearly IMPOSSIBLE to try and wipe all these areas down with a dry rag. The usual solution was to carry a can of WD-40, and when the car wouldn't start to spray all the likely areas and it would then start on the very first time.

I was thinking about this, also. It's quite possible the system transmits, in clear, the serial number of the device being used. That way they can start a tap, get the serial number, and use the warrant for the first tap to get the key.

Whether there is a "why" or not we have to find it. This is Pascal's(?) wager. If there is no why and we spend our lives searching, then we have merely wasted our lives, which were meaningless anyway.

This is a good point. But more of a good point for studying religion than ignoring it.

In the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied Lebanese terrritory is NOT an act of terrorism or murder.  It is  disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich or any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed  solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth. It seems to me, Dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problem on the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant, and heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation. I will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of what the situation really is in South Lebanon.

I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your information we are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the  people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily business, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others are older men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard to imagine ????  It is NOT a "terrorist camp" as you and the Israelis like  to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc..... SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not  know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they are back they announce that they bombed a "terrorist  hideout" where an 8 year old girl just happened to be. We are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is  the Israeli way of telling us that "if you're gonna hurt our soldiers you're gonna pay the price".  We accept this as a price we have to pay to free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting the resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather just keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young  men to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are taking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers. Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING  ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real  leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw. The people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a  regular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists that the so called "Security Zone" is necessary for the protection of  Northern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation with the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace, than it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the  establishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect our villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so the best policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the establishment of peace keeping troops along the border.  I have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure no one on either side of the border is shelled. This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to realize that the concept of a "buffer zone" aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel would have resulted in.   If Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw  unilaterally from the so-called "Security Zone" before the conclusion of the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives, advance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel's  public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations  since Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in  peace and has already offered some important concessions. Along with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah be disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not  accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a shelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone and will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it. There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such  circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of Lebanon.    |> If you ask me those questions, I will have no problem answering (not with a  |> question, as you did) : No, NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder, nothing |> justifies murder.

(Sorry for length).  To increase the MacIISi speed to 25MHz or 33MHz the clock must be changed from 40MHz to 50MHz or 64MHz respectively. This is done by going to a static-free work station or putting some aluminum foil down to work on. 	1. Open up the Si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case. 	2. Remove the Hard Disk by disconnecting the power and SCSI cables, 		spreading the tabs, and lifting the drive out. 	3. Remove the flopy drive. 	4. Remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and lifting 		the supply straight up and out. 	5. Remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back, bottom 		side of the fan and lifting straight up and out. 	6. Remove the Mother Board by spreading the tabs on the left and 		right side of the board and sliding the board forward then 		lifting the board out. (all connectors on the back of the 		board must be removed first) 	7. Desolder the 40MHz clock (the one closest to the memory modules). 		This is not easy even for a skilled solderer. 	8. Get an IC socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins 		by pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers. 	9. Put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder  		them in. 	10.Insert a 50MHz or 64MHz clock. 	11.Put large power transistor heat sink's on the processor chip and  		the other large chip just to the right of the processor and 		figure some way to hold the heat sync's in place. I made a 		simple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the hole 		in the board between the two chips. Mount the screw using 		insulated washers. Screw a cross member down over the heat 		sync's to hold them in place. Don't use too much pressure.  	12. Put it all back together and go-for-it.  Disclaimer: this is only the procedure I used and is not authorized by anyone. 	    You are on your own for this procedure. I'm quite sure it will 	    void your warentee.

Suppose that such a space existed, and that our universe looked like a Black Hole in it. Then our Universe could be open to it through Hawking radiation, the same way Black Holes are within our Universe.

I was also at the Saturday game in Montreal (Apr 17) that Rockies won 9-1. I haven't paid much attention to Gallarraga since he left the Expos but his stance seemed to be MUCH different. He stands more erect and very open, with his left foot pointing to 3rd base. I'm wondering if this is a recent change in stance for him? Andres had one glaring weakness as a hitter. He could always be fooled by a curve ball low and away. If this is indeed a new stance for him, maybe he is not being fooled as easily? As for his patience,  Dennis Martinez definitely did not have his good stuff. If he was grooving pitches to Andres, you can hardly fault him for drilling them (which he did!). Does Andres generally start hot or cold? Does it take until May for most pitchers to have confidence in that curve ball low and away?  Roger Healey

I've also heard rumors that they are bundled with a couple of CD's,  I had mention in a previous article that I was searching for the 300 external drive.

Well, you can guess how I spent my weekend. Of course I ended up paying list price but you do get a free copy of PC Exchange when you order from the Apple Catalog.  You may want to check if they have any internal drives.  BTW, an older version of GateKeeper (I don't recall which version), hung up my Mac when trying to access a photoCD or audio disk.  I got the newer version which did mention a conflict with the Apple 4.xx CD driver.

The X11R5 documentation says: "Usually, a window manager creates  these colormaps."  I wonder what window manager the writer had  in mind.  Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps.  Of course, one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps.   However, xstdcmap doesn't seem to try very hard to avoid  conflicts with the default colormap.  When I use standard  colormaps created by xstdcmap, the rest of my display goes black.   So it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very  problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid.  Perhaps  if every application used standard colormaps, things would  be wonderful.  But not many applications seem to use  standard colormaps.  Finally, the operation of the functions XmuGetColormapAllocation,  XmuStandardColormap, and XmuCreateColormap seem inconsistent  with the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation.      According to the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation (p. 436):      For GrayScale colormaps, only the colormap, red_max, red_mult, and      base_pixel members are defined.  The other members are ignored.       To compute a GrayScale pixel value, use the following expression:              (gray * red_mult + base_pixel) &0xFFFFFFFF      XmuGetColormapAllocation, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CmapAlloc.c, is      used by XmuLookupStandardColormap, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/LookupCmap.c     to select red_max, green_max, and blue_max values for the      call to XmuStandardColormap.  When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is      specified, XmuGetColormapAllocation sets red_max to 30% of the      total number of cells in the gray scale, sets green_max to 59%      of the total number, and sets blue_max ot 11% of the total number.     Referring to section 14.3, one would expect XmuGetColormapAllocation      to set red_max to the total number of cells in the gray scale.      When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is specified, XmuStandardColormap,      defined in mit/lib/Xmu/StdCmap.c, sets red_mult, green_mult,      and blue_mult all equal to 1.  Referring to section 14.3,      one would expect green_mult and blue_mult to be ignored.      When red_mult, green_mult, and blue_mult all equal 1,      XmuCreateColormap, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CrCmap.c, constructs      a gray map. The sum of red_max, green_max, and blue_max gives      the maximum gray value.  Referring to section 14.3, on would      expect red_max to give the maximum gray value.

I took me a long time to come to the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a "rosicrucian" body and BEING *a* ROSICRUCIAN. So when you say that you met some 'rosicrucians' you mean "members of a group that calls themselves rosicrucian". At least that is what your observation suggests :-)   Response:  This makes much sense to me.  This is also true of most religions. There is a difference between being a *member* of a group of people who call themselves 'Hindus' or 'Christians' or 'Pagans' and actually *BEING* any of these.  The social groups tend to make very important requirements about not belonging to other 'religions'.  I find that the ideal described by the holy texts of most religions can be interpreted in very similar ways so that one could presume that 'mysticism' is the core of every religion and Huxley's 'Perennial Philosophy' is the Great Secret Core of all mystical trads. :>   Tony:  I'd prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium Rosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of this newsgroup, with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based (the USA Jurisdiction) in San Jose, CA; this being the RC org with the most members (last time I looked). Of course, "most members" does not *necessarily* mean "best".   Response:  Certainly true.  I didn't know there WERE any groups which called themselves 'Rosicrucians' that didn't associate with AMORC.  Sure, I've heard all the hubbub about the Golden Dawn and Rosae Crucis in relation to all these Western esoteric groups, but hadn't heard about other 'Rosicrucians'. I'll admit my bias.  I live in San Jose. :>   Tony:  "You'll have to trust me" when I tell you that if that lecture/class/whatever had been presented by AMORC, it is unlikely that you would have had the same impression, i.e., you'd probably have had a positive impression more likely than a negative one, IMHO.    Response:  This may be slightly off.  I've met some of these Rosicrucians and have a couple friends in AMORC.  The stories I've heard and the slight contact I've had with them does not give me the hope that I'd be received with any kind of warm welcome.  I still like to think that most people who are involved with stratified relationships (monogamy, religion, etc.) are in DEEP pain and hope to heal it within such a 'cast'.   Tony:        It is curious to know that 3 other RC 'orders' (in the USA) claim to be *non- sectarian*.   Response:  I'd like to know at least the addresses of the 'other orders' which call  themselves 'Rosicrucians' and especially those which are 'nonsectarian'. Is this 'nonsectarian' like the Masons, who require that a member 'believe in God by his/her definition'?              Tony:  I don't see nothing *fundamentally* wrong with "us containing something divine"... And yes I don't like phrases like "eternal bliss" either! :-)   Response:  Let alone us *BEING* something divine. ;>   Tony:  BTW, I have read the intro letters of the LRC which they will mail you free of charge.

Brown Secretary Department of Commerce 14th and Pennsylvania Ave., NW Washington, DC 20236  Dear Secretary Brown:     As you know, I have long been interested in the privacy  and security of telecommunications transmissions and data in  a networked environment.  Recent reports concerning the  Administration's endorsement of an electronic encryption  standard, based upon "clipper chip" technology, have raised a  number of related issues.  The international competitiveness  of U.S. high tech manufacturers and the software industry is  a key factor that the government should consider when  addressing issues of encryption and data security.  As the  nation moves forward in developing the national  communications and information infrastructure, security of  telecommunications transmissions and network data will be an  increasingly important factor for protecting the privacy of  users.     The "hacker" community can compromise the integrity of  telecommunications transmissions and databases linked by the  network.  The people and businesses that use the nation's  telecommunications network and the personal computers linked  through it increasingly are demanding that information be  protected against unauthorized access, alteration, and theft.     I am concerned that the Administration's plan may mean  that to remain competitive internationally, U.S. companies  would be compelled to develop two products -- one for U.S.  government customers, and another for private, commercial  users who may want a higher encryption standard.  This may  inadvertently increase costs to those U.S. companies hoping  to serve both markets.  To assist the Subcommittee's analysis  of this issue, please respond to the following questions:  1. Has the encryption algorithm or standard endorsed by the  Administration been tested by any entity other than NSA, NIST  or the vendor?  If so, please identify such entities and the  nature of testing performed.  If not, please describe any  plans to have the algorithm tested by outside experts and how  such experts will be chosen.  2. Under the Administration's plan, what entities will be the  holders of the "keys" to decrypt scrambled data?  What  procedures or criteria will the Administration utilize to  designate such key holders?  3. Does the encryption algorithm endorsed by the  Administration contain a "trap door" or "back door," which  could allow an agency or entity of the Federal government to  crack the code?  4. It is clear that over time, changes in technologies used  for communications will require new techniques and additional  equipment.  How will encryption devices adapt to the rapid  advancement of telecommunications technology?  5. What additional costs would the proposed encryption place  on the Federal government?  What is the estimated cost to  consumers and businesses which opt for the federal standard  in their equipment?  6. What is the Commerce Department's assessment of the  competitive impact of the Administration's endorsement of the  "clipper chip" technology on U.S. exports of computer and  telecommunications hardware and software products?     I would appreciate your response by no later than close- of-business, Wednesday, April 28, 1993.

But do we write about historical ownership of any place - Palestine, Pakistan, Cyprus, Aegean Islands (and the oil that may lie beneath them), whatever - for any reason other than justification for stomping others?  DOES IT TRULY MATTER whose ancestor lived where 20, 200, or 2000 years ago?  More than how you treat the land and each other?  Who is wise enough to decree that a person's right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness in a particular place depends on accidents of birth?  Who can even be sure about the precise tracks of the sperm that birthed the people we wish to despise?  IMHO, the American Indians have it right.  We belong to the earth, it does not belong to us.  Failure to understand that is a good way to cause lossage all the way around.  My guess is that once we trash our environment sufficiently we shall die along with it - the baby eating and killing its mother, then dying for lack of milk.  Death and disease do not respect national boundaries, not as toxins, disease vectors,  lost farmland/wetlands/forest cover/water supplies, nor any other way.  When we fight over which national group owns which piece of turf, we are merely contending for the best vantage point from which to kill others, "our" land and eventually ourselves.  That is something of which to be proud.  Very proud.  Makes me glad to be human.   I'm not mindlessly rejecting all nationalism.  Maybe it's fair to ask whether a recent immigrant deserves a share of the infrastructure that all _my_ ancestors (hah!) labored to produce.  But it's an artificial distinction: is the recent immigrant, even a refugee, less likely to contribute to the next generation's legacy than anyone else?  [In history the reverse is often the case: recent immigrants strive hardest.  If nothing else, they fill open eco(l/n)ogic niches.]  Then again, my tribe is infinitely better than your tribe, so I can understand you all have nothing but plot to knock me off.  While I, of course, will make sure it doesn't happen, even if I must shoot Muslim infants (or bash Jewish ones against the walls of schoolhouses) to do so.  That'll prove my moral superiority, by golly, as well as the rightness of my cause.   Clearly, there is no higher purpose in life than killing others because they are not like you.  I would never get in the way of such fun.  Let's see:   	soc.culture.turkish - Why don't you Turks go back to Lake 		Baikal where you came from, and leave the land to the 		Greeks, who stole it fair and square from the 		Scythians? 	soc.culture.pakistan - Why don't you guys redistribute 		yourselves over India, as God meant for you to do? 	soc.culture.jewish, soc.culture.arabic - we stick together, 		fight together, die together.  We are brothers, and 		inseparable. 	talk.politics.mideast - oh well, had to be there.  Oded [Planning on being a Scythian irredentist, as soon as I finish my present assignment.]   P.S.:	I can't get a semi-decent death threat anymore?  P.P.S.:	Yeh, the Native Americans had it right.  We had to kill them 		off to keep their sedition from spreading.

The user dials up a remote system and downloads a batch of mail as "foo.txt ." I've set up an AutoExec macro in Winword to load "foo.txt" OK, but subsequent invocations of the macro will of course pose file name contention problems.  What I'd really like to do is to create an AutoExit macro in Winword that would move "foo.txt" to a specified directory, rename it using the current date and time, and delete the original "foo.txt ."  In other words, "foo.txt" gets renamed as "5012300", say, on May 1 at 23:00- the user gets a time-indexed backup of his mail files and "foo.txt" is freed up for the next packet of mail, since my AutoExec macro points to it.  My main question is this:   How may one rename a file from within a WordBasic macro to include a  time/date variable in the new filename?

Thanks for a well put testimonial. Stan Krieger and his kind who think this discussion doesn't belong here and his intolerance is the only acceptable position in scouting should take notice. The BSA has been hijacked by the religious right, but some of the core values have survived in spite of the leadership and some scouts and former scouts haven't given up. Seeing a testimonial like this reminds me that scouting is still worth fighting for.  On a cautionary note, you must realize that if your experience with this camp leader was in the BSA you may be putting him at risk by publicizing it. Word could leak out to the BSA gestapo.

In the past I have used Visual Edge's UIM/X product to develop other GUIs, so I am familiar with UIMSs in general.  The topology will support objects and connecting links.  Once the topology is created, I want to provide the user with capabilities to support grouping, zooming, etc.  I am looking for some form of a higher abstraction other than X drawing routines to accomplish this.

With DayStar's upgrade path, it's a no lose situation.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  Earl D.

I myself do not notice any deity.  Hence a model cannot be made.  A deity is an abstract, and hence religion may be considered a model of an abstract.  Besides, we can always change the model of gravity if the one we have doesn't work too well.  Can you imagine this with the bible?

Is this correct?  The reason is this - I have a Rombo Media Pro+ video digitising card. It chroma keys its output into the vga monitor signal. However, although it is supposed to work with an ET-4000 with Hi-colour RAMDAC, the colours on screen behave as if the top 2 bits of colour information are missing, and red, green, blue signals are swapped around. Rombo has suggested that this may be due to insufficient buffering on the feature connector outputs, and is happy to sell me a buffer device for 50 pounds. I would rather save about 45 pounds, and build my own. I assume it would require (for example) a 74F244 buffer IC (or two).  Can anyone help? Any information on the feature connector would be highly appreciated!

Date: Wed, 21 Apr 1993 14:34:03 GMT Lines: 22  I was privelged enough to experience my first Volvo attack this weekend.  I was last in a line of traffic that was about 6 vehicles long, riding down Rt. 40 in Groton Ma.  At the side of the road, sitting off on the shoulder was the killer Volvo in question.  No brake lights, no turn signal, nothing.  We were doing about 40 mph and I was following the cage in front of me about 2.5-3 sec. back.  Well, as said cage passes the Volvo, the Brain Dead Idiot (tm) behind the wheel decides that she doesn't need to wait for me to pass also and turns out perpendicular across both lanes of traffic so that she can turn around...  So I get on the brakes in a effort to not T-bone it, and the horn in an effort to wake the BDI up.  As she finishes the turn, she looks up at me with a completely blank, uncomprehending stare.

Message-ID: <May.12.04.28.31.1993.9972@athos.rutgers.edu> Date: 12 May 93 08:28:32 GMT Sender: hedrick@athos.rutgers.edu Organization: Silicon Graphics, St. Louis, MO Lines: 84 Approved: christian@aramis.rutgers.edu  I have enrolled in "The History of Christianity" at a college here in St. Louis. The teacher of the class is what I consider to be closed-minded and bigotted on the subject of what the definition of Christianity is.  His definition is tied directly to that of the Trinity and the Catholic church's definition of it and belief in Jesus Christ is not sufficient to call one's self a Christian.  While his saying it doesn't make it so,  I nevertheless feel insulted (or am I just neurotic? :^) ). I would like to be able to respond to him with some sense of literacy while maintaining an amiable student-teacher relationship.  So, is there common definition of what Christianity is?  As the previous discussion of the Trinity did not lend itself to an exchange of flames, I am hopeful that this will also not produce major flames.  Regards, -- Larry Autry Silicon Graphics, St. Louis autry@sgi.com     [Often we get into discussions about who is Christian.  Unfortunately there are a number of possible definitions.  Starting from the  broadest, commonly used definitions are:    a historical definition   people who accept Christ as Lord and savior   a broad doctrinal definition   narrow doctrinal definitions  1) By a historical definition I mean the sort of definition a secular historian would likely use.  This would include any group that developed out of the Christian church, and continues within the same broad culture.  E.g. some Unitarians would fail just about any doctrinal test you could come up with.  Yet it's clear that that group developed from Christianity, and people from very different backgrounds (e.g. Hindus) would likely see them as part of Christianity.  This is not a definition most Christians like, but it's relevant in some political and ethnic contexts.  2) Accepting Christ as Lord and savior is a test used by many Christian groups for membership, e.g. the Southern Baptists and Presbyterian Church (USA).  I would qualify it by saying that what most people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to Christ, so that someone who accepted Christ as one of many gods would not fit.  It's an attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based on technical doctrine.  By this definition, groups such as Arians would be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christians.  In the modern context this would include Mormons, JW's, and "oneness Pentecostals".  They would be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christian.  In practice I believe just about everyone who falls into this category would accept the Apostle's Creed.  3) The next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition, which includes all of the major strands of Christianity, but excludes groups that are felt to be outside "historic Christianity."  This is of course a slippery enterprise, since Catholics could argue that Protestants are outside historic Christianity, etc.  But I think the most commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the Nicene Creed and the Formula of Chalcedon.  The attempt is to characterize doctrines that all major strands of Christianity agree are key.  Obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement.  A Mormon will regard the LDS church as a major strand, and thus will not want to include anything that contradicts their beliefs.  But I think this definition would have fairly broad acceptance.  4) Finally, some people use definitions that I would say are limited to a specific Christian tradition.  E.g. some evangelicals only consider someone Christian if he has had an evangelical-style conversion experience, and some I've even heard of groups that limit it to their specific church.  I think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used. A lot is going to depend upon the purpose you're using it for.  If you're using it descriptively, e.g. in history or anthropology, you'll probably use definition 1 or 2.  If you're using it normatively, i.e. to say what you believe the Christian message is, you'll probably use a definition like 3 or even 4.  --clh]

The whole "saddam is going to invade Saudi Arabia" was nothing but US State Department propeganda.  Saddam (and Iraq in general) never recognised the  British created Kuwait.  They were trying to recover land they believed was theirs, much like the Argentines in the Faulklands.  The Kuwaitis pushed just a little too far by taking Iraqi oil and Saddam thought he'd settle the dispute the old fashioned way... Everybody would have been much better off had they left the reunited Iraq together and concentrated on taking out Saddam.  A strong, united Iraq with an elected government would have gone a long way to ridding the world of the feudal dictatorships in the Gulf. But of course a weak divided Arab people better suits US foriegn policy...  The US had no problem killing tens of thousands of ill-equipted Iraqi soldiers, including burying several thousand alive and slaughtering retreating batallions from the air in defense of Kuwaiti oil, but it has yet to lift a finger against Bosnian Serbs while they slaughter Bosnian muslims....

Opinion polls show that most people belive the Bill of Rights to grant too much freedom to people, when it is not identified as such (BTW, if anyone knows of a cite for that, I'd love to have it).  Not only does this mean that these people are  willing to give up everyone (else's) rights, they don't even know what  the Bill of Rights actually says.  How can we show the average person (not the average USENET reader) that people are actually entitiled to these rights?  So many people don't care if the government is taking more and more control of us all, a little  at a time.    If there was some sort of awareness of what the government is trying to do by a majority of the US population... Just think about what could be accomplished - but there are so many that trust, unthinkingly, in whatever the media and government tell them.

The lengthier games >are so because of batters stepping out of the box, pitchers taking >longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers >and pitching coaches. >  Until six or seven years ago I was an enthusiastic fan of NFL football. Last year I hardly watched a game.  What turned me off were the incessant interruptions to the continuity of the game.  A team scores. 2.5 minutes of commercials.  Kickoff.  1.5 minutes of commercials. Three downs and a punt.  2 minutes of commercials.  AAAAARRRRGH!  Earlier in this thread I commented on LaRussa and the A's, whom I believe institutionalize slow play.  I don't mind the cat-and-mouse game with Rickey on first;  in fact, I rather enjoy it.  Similarly I would enjoy the battle with Listach or Lofton or Polonia on first.  What I object to is when such games are played with Karkovice on first, or when the game is a blowout.  I don't mind when the pitcher steps off  the mound to gather his thoughts in a crucial situation, or when a hitter steps out of the box to regain his concentration.  What I object to is when hitters and pitchers take such breaks at every opportunity. When a game is exciting, these little delays serve as tension builders and for me enhance the value of the experience of the game.  When the delays happen with regularity, they become nuisances, just like the commercial breaks in football.    I understand the NFL imposed a number of rule changes to "speed up" the games, basically putting an onus on the officiating staff to move the markers and the ball to the spots faster.  That did not address the problem of the continuity of the game.  It may have appeased the sponsors and the networks, but I would be amazed if it did anything to enhance the experience of the fans.  Similary, while some 3-hour baseball games bore me to tears, those are the ones where there is no continuity and the players are taking exasperatingly long periods to get ready for each pitch.  I doubt if anyone watching the Braves-Giants game cared about Gant stepping out.  I doubt if anyone watching that game would have found that pause to be anything but an opportunity to have their complete attention claimed by the drama that was present.  I would be totally opposed to any effort that would eliminate that aspect of baseball.  On the other hand, I wish baseball had a commissioner that was powerful enough to sit down with Alderson/LaRussa/Duncan and explain that they are actually hurting the product of baseball by dragging their games  out the way that they do.  I sure wouldn't mind a little arm-twisting there.    --	The Beastmaster      --  Mark Singer     mss@netcom.com

Then President Clinton said he wanted families who make more than $100,000 to bear 70% of the new tax burden, and many were quick to complain that their six-figure income does not make them one of the well-to-do.  It's particularly ironic (to me) that it's in those traditionally liberal enclaves of the Bay Area and academia where the wealthy are struggling so to fit themselves into the mantle of "just regular working-class folk".  Nobody will ever admit to being rich; everybody's middle class.  So who are The Rich?  Well, I'll throw out some stats from the 1990 Census and let you be the judge...

The poverty line for a family of four is $15,171.  If they make up to twice that, the government considers them to be "working poor".  Say we decide to call this the "lower-middle-class".  Then how 'bout:  $30-50K annual income is "middle-class".  $50-100K is "upper-middle-class". $100K+ is "rich".  $1,000K+ is "filthy-rich".  and $10,000+ is "Bill Gates".  make sense? ;^)  -timr  -- There's nothing surer, The rich get rich and the poor get poorer, In the meantime, in between time, Ain't we got fun.                                                           --Raymond Egan

Even if what Brad says turns out to be accurate, you can bet that the Administration will have made it "very clear" to the vendors that "it would very much be in their best interests" to institute a "voluntary" policy of refusing to sell anything but Clinton Cripple equipped equipment to anyone other than "Authorized government agencies and Law Enforcement", or individuals and corporations who "have been been determined by the Administration to have a valid need on a case-by-case basis" for an effective system.  Note that this is very much like the language used in many gun control bills/laws the Administration is pushing for, or otherwise supporting. The logic and actual rationale (as opposed to the excuses that get fed to the media) is the same in both cases, only the items or technology in question are different.  I think this is no accident.  It comes from the same philosophy that the government rules/controls the people, not the people controlling the government, that the unconnected citizens are not sophisticated enough to know what is best for them, so the government must tell the people what they need or do not need ... "we know best...".  And the idea that that a commoner can defend himself against government eavesdropping or unlawful attack is totally unacceptable to people with this outlook.  > >Hal Finney  Combine this all with pushing for national identity cards with 'smart chips' to encode anything they please (internal passport) under the guise of streamlining the State People's Health Care System, and with (you can be certain) more jewels yet to come, and one sees an extremely ominous trend.  So what if "1984" will be ten years late... it still is turning out to be an amazingly accurate prophecy... unless a LOT of people wake up, and in a hurry.  One should ALWAYS have every red warning light and bell and danger flag come up when the government seeks to set itself apart in regard to rights, etc.  from the unconnected/unprivileged citizen (or should we now be saying 'subject' instead?)...

Why SHOULDN'T the average person be able to defend himself from an agency gone rogue?  0I am sure the Feds could break into any data they really wanted to (but it would take some WORK), and using the same logic, one should not be allowed to have a good safe, unless a duplicate of the key(s) or combination are submitted for 'safekeeping' by the government?

The LC can easily handle the SCSI transfer rate of the CD300.  None of the current Macs, even the Quadras, support SCSI-2 unless you get a SCSI-2 Nubus Card.    You don't have to have double speed to use PhotoCD.  It's just faster reading images off of a disk.  I think that the CD150 can handle PhotoCD, but only single session.  The CD300 can do multisession PhotoCD.  Paul

In many types ofexperiments the "prediction" is that the observed phenomena will happen again and be capable of being observed. For example, in chemistry someone may predict the outcome of a chemical reaction and then actually observe that reaction  repeatedly. You can't repeat or ever know for sure the original conditions that produced life. So it seems we could never say, "That's exactly how it happened."As far as we know that event was unobserved. (At least no one has admitted it. :-) ) So unlike the chemistry experiment repeatability and observability, strictly speaking, are lacking. --   +----------------------------------------------------------+ | Joe Duffy                          duffy@asl.dl.nec.com  | | NEC America, Inc.                                        |

It is all written in _The_Wholly_Babble:_the_Users_Guide_to_Invisible_ _Pink_Unicorns_.  To be granted faith in invisible pink unicorns, you must read the Babble, and obey what is written in it.  To obey what is written in the Babble, you must believe that doing so is the way to be granted faith in invisible pink unicorns.

Previously I had been using a Variable Speed Overdrive for accelerating my CPU but this modification is testing out as more stable at higher speeds.  Your mileage may vary. The top speed you achieve cannot be predicted before hand. My personal Q700 has tested fine up to 32 mhz thus far. I didn't have higher speed clock oscillators on hand to test higher speeds.  Parts  	Clock Oscillators (4 pin TTL variety) You will need a selection of 	speeds beginning at 50 mhz on up. The CPU will run at 1/2 the 	oscillator speed. The original one is a 50 mhz unit. I recommend 	getting a 50 mhz clock in case you damage the existing one.  	   I obtained my clock oscillators from DigiKey 1-800-344-4539 for 	   less than $5.00 each. Some of their part numbers are:  		   50 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X121) 		   62 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X136) 		   66 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # CTX137)  	   Don't get the half size clock oscillators. They won't fit.  	   There are also CMOS clock oscillators. I haven't tried one in a 	   Quadra. (They work fine in IIsi's) 	    	Socket: Obtain a 4 pin socket which is in the same form factor as 	   a 14 pin DIP package. Alternatively, use 4 machined socket pins 	   from an Augat style socket. Just cut them out of the socket.  	Cooling Fan: A very small 12 volt fan to keep the CPU cool is a  	   must. My VSO came with a specially modified heatsink which had 	   a fan built onto it. It had a pass-through connector which 	   tapped into the hard drive power cable. You should rig up  	   something similar or risk frying your CPU. 	    Procedure  1)  Insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here.  2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and     hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static     precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do     this. Unplug ALL cables, wall and monitor power supply cords from 	the back of the mac.   3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the     tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.     The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the     tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may     also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power     supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you     need release.   4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon     SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable     leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.     The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed     to release it.                                              5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount  6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A     phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop     it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful     here.  7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the     right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding 	posteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then 	lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.  8)  Remove the interrupt switch assembly. It is a strangely shaped plastic     device at the left, front edge of the motherboard. Pull the middle, 	rear plastic prong up and forward. The entire device will release. 	 9)  Unplug the speaker cable. Squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to     free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case. 	 10) Remove the motherboard form the case. Lift the front right corner of     the motherboard about 1 mm. This allows it to clear the clear plastic 	Power light guide. Slide the motherboard forward about 1 cm. The 	motherboard then comes directly out. 	 11) Locate the 50 mhz clock crystal. It is a small metal box near the     CPU chip. Note and remember its orientation. The new clock oscillators 	must be aligned with pin 1 in the same orientation. 	 	Very carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator. Some of 	the pins may be bent over. Simply desolder then unbend them. Be sure 	your desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board. 	 	I used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task. This is 	NOT appropriate for a first soldering experience. The motherboard is 	a multi-layer design with very fine traces - easily damaged without 	proper care. 	 12) Install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was.  13) Put a 50 mhz clock oscillator into the new socket. You could use the 	old clock but it has solder on its pins. This may come of inside the 	socket and cause corrosion problems later. I suggest using a new 	50 mhz clock. 	 14) Install your cooling fan system to complete the modification. 	 14) Reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place.  15) Snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother     board firmly. Plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard. 	 16) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the     tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about 	1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into 	place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.     Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks     into place. 	 17) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY     DRIVE CABLE.  18) Replace the phillips head screw  19) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.  20) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount.  21) Reattach your cables and power cords. Cross your fingers and turn      on the Mac. It should make the usual power on chord. If it doesn't, 	something is amiss. Immediately turn of the power and recheck your 	handiwork. If all is not well, you have my sincere condolences. 	 	Hopefully, all will work normally. Turn the machine back off and 	replace the 50 mhz clock oscillator with a faster one. Reboot and 	be astounded.  	 	You will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding 	a particular speed is truly usable. With my VSO, a machine lock-up 	might take 8 hours of operation to occur. In the brief time since 	modifying my clock oscillator (36 hours) I have not had a single 	problem. 	 Good Luck to all who attempt this modification. There is a small but real risk, but you could well reach Quadra 950 speeds or higher with less than $50 in parts.  Guy Kuo <guykuo@u.washington.edu>

There were no CS CANISTERS... a specially modified Abrams was pupming the stuff in. No chance of starting a fire there. Kerosene lamps? Maybe one, but not three fires. No way. Koresh wasn't just talking out of his ass. I expected this to happen.  Maybe they WANTED it to look like murder. He had 50+ days. I think this was coming the whole time. He didn't even put the children in the buried bus or the underground bunker during the CS seige. He put them up into the tower to die. Fuck all of you "Big Brother" paranoid freaks.

The only record of impact comes from the New Testament. I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that the recorded "impact" actually happened.  I find it interesting that no other contemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain being torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus' resurrection is from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 years after the supposed event.  (2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no one knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers). Don't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament does record that Jews believed the body had been stolen.  If there were really guards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did.  -Scott O.

I purchased it via some mail order catalog when the 4 year old battery in my Oldsmobile would run down during Summer when I was riding my bike more than driving my car. Knowing I'd be selling the car in a year or so, I purchased the charger. Believe it or not, the thing worked.  The battery held a charge and energetically started the car, many times after 4 or 5 weeks of just sitting.  Eventually I had to purchase a new battery anyway because the Winter sun wasn't strong enough due to its low angle.  I think I paid $29 or $30 for the charger.  There are more powerful, more expensive ones, but I purchased the cheapest one I could find.  I've never used it on the bike because I have an E-Z Charger on it and keep it plugged in all the time the bike is garaged.  Arnie Skurow

The term arrhythmia is usually used to encompass a wide range of abnormal heart rhythms (cardiac dysrhythmias).  Some of them are very serious while others are completely benign.  Having "a few irregular beats" on an EKG could be serious depending on what those beats were and when they occurred, or could be of no significance.  Low blood potassium levels probably predispose people with underlying heart disease to develop arrhythmias.  Very low potassium levels are clearly dangerous, but it is not clear how much of a problem low-end-of-normal levels are:  a lot of cardiologists seem to treat anyone with even a mildly low-normal potassium level.  --  David Rind rind@enterprise.bih.harvard.edu

From what I've heard (pure hearsay) the results of outputting    TT fonts as Type 1 is _not_ as good as using high-quality Type 1 fonts in    the first place.  Unless you `print' to file with the correct resolution set for the final output device (image setter).  A problem with TT fonts in Windows is that they do get converted to T1 format OK, and the hinting is even used while this is done, but the resulting T1 fonts are NOT hinted.  The result is that they WILL work fine on a device of the resolution assumed by the printer driver when the PS file is generated, but they will not look good when printed at a different resolution.    So when you print to an attached PS printer, with the PS driver set up for this printer results, may be quite good.  But if you take a PS file made for that printer and run it on a device of different resolution (such as an image setter), then the results may not be so good.

If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,  but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than just a "we have  the money, why not?" approach.  It's conceivable that Luna will have a military purpose, it's possible that Luna will have a commercial purpose, but it's most likely that Luna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred years at least. Therefore, Lunar bases should be predicated on funding levels little different from those found for Antarctic bases. Can you put a 200 person base on the Moon for $30 million a year? Even if you use grad students?

Currently a cracker needs to find the _only_ (*1) key that produces the given ciphertext.  He has to try about 2^63 keys on the average. In the proposed method the cracker only needs _any pair_ of key halves. If he can store about 2^32 guesses for one half, he is likely to find a mathching pair in about 2^32 guesses.  (Here I have assumed that the DES-encryption is reversable, if the key is guessed.  Is this so or do the modifications of the S-boxes by the salt bits make it non-reversable?)  *1 Probably there is only one key; I think there is 1 chance in about 128 that there are two or more keys (can anyone verify this?), but this doesn't help the cracker much.

There is an option (BIOS I think) where additional wait(s) can be added with regard to CPU/VL bus transactions.  This slows the CPU down to a rate that gives the VL bus device(s) time to 'do their thing'.  These particular wait(s) are applied when the CPU transacts with VL bus device(s).  You want to enable these wait(s) only if you are using a 50-DX with VL bus devices.  This is from reading my motherboard manual, and these are my interpre- tations.  Your mileage may vary.  Strictly speaking, VL and 50mhz are not compatable.  And, there is at least one 'fudge' mechanism to physically allow it to work.  --  Gary Korenek   (korenek@ferranti.com) Network Management Technology Incorporated (formerly Ferranti International Controls Corp.)

In _The Revolt_ Begin does state that the *myth* of a massacre at Deir Yassin may have had the effect of scaring some Arabs into fleeing. However, nowhere does he claim that this was the result of any specific policy of the Etzel.  Thus, if it did happen, it was not so intended.  I think Arab  calls for Palestinians to leave and fear of a war started by Arab hands had  a greater effecton Arab migration than Deir Yassin.  In fact these jewish TERRORIST groups managed >all in all to scare off 300, 000 Arabs by may 15 1948.  Really.  Nice use of caps.  I like it.  Very effective.

For the Bruins, it was the stuff of nightmares; for the Sabres, it was a taste of heaven.      For the first time since 1983, the Sabres have won the first three games of a series.  Last time was a three games to none victory in a best of five against the Canadiens.  It takes a little more work this time.  The Sabres seem ready to put in the extra work.    On the heels of a shutout, one that took away Boston's home ice advantage, the Sabres came back with a four to three overtime win.  It wasn't easy.  It wasn't always pretty.  It still worked.    John Blue got the nod for Boston, supplanting Andy Moog as starting goaltender.  Moog was pulled midway through game 2 on Tuesday. Buffalo started with a goal by Mogilny, his fourth of the playoffs, on the powerplay, with Boston's Don Sweeney and Gord Roberts in the box. LaFontaine and Hawerchuk had the assists.  Goal number two was Khmylev's first of the playoffs, a pretty goal scored when the Sabres stole the puck and passed to an open and waiting Khmylev.  Smehlik and Hannan assisted.  Determined not to be shut out, Boston tallied on a shot by Ray Bourque on the powerplay, with Colin Patterson and Bob Sweeney both in the box.  Period two was scoreless, a split of penalties between the two clubs.  The third saw Boston's Smolinski get his first, courtesy of Oates.  Buffalo resecured the lead two minutes later, from former Bruin Bob Sweeney (Khmylev and Carney).  Neely tied the game 3/4 of the way through the third, sending it into overtime. Last year overtime meant a Bruin win.  Last night, it spelled sweet revenge, as Buffalo scored with Ray Bourque in the penalty box, on a tip in by Khmylev (Hawerchuk and LaFontaine) a minute into overtime. Both teams finished with 34 shots.           Power-play conversions--Boston 5-1. Buffalo 7-2.         Referee--Rob Shick.  Comments:  Shick pocketed the whistle in the third, allowing a lot of clutching and grabbing.  Buffalo's penalty killing unit was fantastic again.  Mogilny was checking.  Granted he missed once and instead flung his body into the boards, but checking like this is a novel idea to Mogilny.  The crowd was unbelievable.  I don't think I've ever heard a crowd that loud in the Aud for a Sabres game (remember, I was only five when they played for the cup.  I don't remember it and no one took me to the games).  Doug Bodger, in a postgame interview, noted that he tried to say something to Hawerchuk, but the crowd was too loud, even though he was shouting.  It didn't seem to matter, as most of the Sabres and even Muckler said it was great.  Yuri Khmylev didn't seem to realize that he was the game's third star and didn't skate out when his name was called.  Sweeney (2) and Fuhr (1) each were out before Yuri made his appearance, sans jersey.  When asked in an interview later whether he knew how big a goal that was, he responed yes (ok, it was through an interpreter and he said more than that, even more than the interpreter said, but I digress).  The interviewer seemed to think just because he doesn't speak English, he must not understand playoffs.  Uh-huh.   --  Valerie Hammerl 	       John Sr. would lift Pat over the boards, grab  hammerl@acsu.buffalo.edu       his hand, and start running around the outside, V085PWPZ@UBVMS.CC.BUFFALO.EDU  faster and faster.

Well, partly because I, as an ardent fan of both sports, would rather see Game 3 of the NHL playoffs than Game 3 of 162 of the MLB season (even if the bb game involves the Red Sox).	  ESPN may have had contractual obligations. I understand that part. But it's a bit inaccurate to call us "selfish" just because we want to watch the watch the game we love. Am I, as a baseball fan, "selfish" when I get pissed a CBS for showing approximately one game per month? I don't think so.

Is a fatwa going to be leashed out against the perpetrators?  Do you honestly think that someone who did it would voluntarily come forward and confess?

Perhaps people that indulge in this practice agree with you in theory, but hope that Allah will forgive them in the end.  I think it's rather arrogant of you to pretend to speak for all muslims in this regard.  Also, kind of silly.  Are you insinuating that because the Koranic law forbids it, there are no criminals in muslim countries?   This is as far as I care to go on this subject.

IMHO this are going from bad to worse. 3-in-1, 1-in-3 was bad enough.   I do not like a God who prays to Himself.  I refuse to believe Jesus prayed to Himself  --   let's get real, if the scriptures say He prayed to the Father, then the Father IS someone different than the Son.  I have no problems with multiple Gods.  To me, the whole context of the scriptures says:  Be perfect, even as your Father Who is in Heaven; that we can be co-heirs with Christ; that we will be like Him.   Co-heirs share all things equally--including knowledge, power, dominion etc. When I am like Him (Christ), I will be the same as HE is--and He is a God.   If God cannot do this, the His is not all powerful--and He is NOT God. If He will not, He is a Liar--and He is NOT God.   But if He does, He is the greatest of all the Gods.    [I don't know of anyone who says that Jesus prayed to himself.  The whole point of the Trinity is that there's enough of a distinction within God that relationship is possible.  This implies some sort of communication.  I assume that in their "native" form, the Father and Son are directly enough connected that prayer in our sense isn't involved.  But Jesus is the incarnation of the Son, i.e.  the Logos made flesh.  When he's in a human form, his human actions are limited to human capabilities.  So communication with the Father takes the form of prayer.  I don't see that there's anything problematical about that.  It seems to be implicit in the whole idea of incarnation. --clh]

I thought the deal was great, so I went on with it.    I sent him the memory COD FOR $100.  He was then suppose to send me the cpu. I receive his COD payment on 4/8/93.  He send me a message the he sent the cpu out 4/16/93.  It has been two weeks, and I didn't receive the CPU.  I send him numerous message asking for confirmation that the cpu was ship, or what address he send it to (to make sure it didn't get lost in the mail.) He never reply my mail.    I finally resorted to calling him in Arizona.  The first call didn't get throught, I got  an answering machine.  I left him my number.  He didn't reply. I call again the next day and he pick up the phone.  I asked him if he had send out the cpu.  He said yes, but he doesn't know what address he sent it to.    He said that you would check his record at home and call me back the next day. To my suprise, He never called.  I then send him some more email messages, he never reply again. (strang, when the deal was being made, he reply to every of my message, now that He got my memory, He won't even reply to me.)  Now:  I am still calling him, but he won't pick up the phone.  I am also still       emailing him, but he won't reply my mail.  So if any one know this DANA WEICK, please contact him. he can be reach at: 			Dana Weick 			4238 W Las Palmaritas 			Phoenix, AZ 85051     (602)925-6123 in the day time this is his business number.

Thanks  ****ON 4/8 I SEND HIM AND SAID... that I got the cod payment. and asked if the cpu is sent out yet >Is the CPU sent out yet? ****HE REPLIED.....ON 4/9  Glad the COD payment got to you OK, the CPU has been sent so keep your eyes out for it.  Be *very* careful when you install it, be careful of static discharge, bending pins during insertion and above all make absolutely certain you plug the chip in the proper orientation.  The chip was checked out prior to shipping and if you cook it by plugging it in backwards I won't be real sympathetic!    If you don't know how to tell what orientation the chip should be installed,  DON'T GUESS!   ********************************DANA WEICK UPDATE:****************************  I call him sunday, his wife Debbie picked up the phone.  She said that he was  busy with his kids, and he would call me back in 10 minuets.  Half an house went by, Weick didn't called.  I called him again, and his phone was discon- nected.  Since this post,  I have numberous people who mail me saying that this DANA WEICK have ripped them off.  We got do something about this guy.  He has appearrently been doing this for a few years now.

They may be permanently damaging their body.  That is true.  It is also none of your business.    Some people may also reason that by reading the bible and being a Xtian you are permanently damaging your brain.  By your logic, it would be OK for them to come into your home, take away your bible, and send you off to "re-education camps" to save your mind from ruin.  Are you ready for that?        /(hudson) /And why is there nothing wrong with it?  Because you say so?  Who gave you /the authority to say that, and set the standard for morality?  Why?  Because:  I am a living, thinking person able to make choices for myself. I do not "need" you to show me what you think is the way; I have observed too many errors in your thinking already to trust you to make up the rules for me.  Because: I set the standard for my *own* morality, and I permit you to do  the same for yourself.  I also do not try to force you to accept my rules.  Because: Simply because you don't like what other people are doing doesn't give you the right to stop it, Hudson.  We are all aware that you would like for  everyone to be like you.  However, it is obnoxious, arrogant thinking like  yours, the "I-know-I'm-morally-right-so-I-can-force-it-on-you" bullshit  that has brought us religious wars, pogroms against Jews, gay-bashing, and other atrocities by other people who, like you, "knew" they were morally right.      (me) >What is it with you, Hudson?  You think you know better than other people, >so you want to be able to tell them what they can and cannot do to  >themselves?  Who died and made you God?  How come I can't do the same >thing?    /(hudson) /Aren't you?  Aren't you indicating that I should not tell other people what to do?  Aren't you telling me it is wrong for me to do that?   It is not a moral standard that I am presenting you with, Hudson.  It is a key to getting along in life with other people.  It is also a point of respect:  I trust other people to be intelligent enough to make their own choices, and I expect the same to be returned.  You, on the other hand, do not trust them, and want to make the choice for them--whether they like it or not.  It is also a way to avoid an inconsistency:  if you believe that you have  the right to set moral standards for others and interfere in their lives,  then you must, by logic, admit that other people have the same right of  interference in your life.   (Yes, I know; you will say that your religion is correct and tells you that only agents acting in behalf of your religion have the right of interference. However, other people will say that you have misinterpreted the Word of God and that *they* are the actual true believers, and that you are acting on your own authority.  And so it goes).      (hudson) /Who gave /you the authority to set such a moral standard for me to tell me that I  /cannot set a moral standard for others?   You can set all the standards that you want, actually.  But don't be surprised if people don't follow you like rats after the Pied Piper.    At the most basic form, I am not going to LET you tell me what to do; and if necessary, I will beat you to a bloody pulp before I let you actually interfere in my life.  Now, at a more humane level than that, I recognize that all people are sentient beings possessed of intelligence and capable of reason.  I also recognize that they, like I, appreciate being treated with respect and allowed to make their own decisions.

My HD was stacked with Stacker v.2.0 (I run Dos5) Suddenly everything hung up, and most of the HD got corrupted (directories changed into unreadable files with 'funny' names).

Besides, all your article reflects is your abundant ignorance. Ignorance is probably the main reason why you historical revisionist are in such a mess.

It certainly is possible to severe the artificial   life-support system of an imagined 'ethnic purity' that some of us   falsely trust as the only structure that can support their heart beats    in this alien land."             (Sahak Melkonian - 1920 - "Preserving the Armenian purity")    "An appropriate analogy with the Jewish Holocaust might be the  systematic extermination of the entire Muslim population of   the independent republic of Armenia which consisted of at   least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic. The   memoirs of an Armenian army officer who participated in and   eye-witnessed these atrocities was published in the U.S. in  1926 with the title 'Men Are Like That.' Other references abound."      (Rachel A. Bortnick - The Jewish Times - June 21, 1990)    1."Men Are Like That" by Leonard A. Hartill, Bobbs Co., Indianapolis,     1926     Memoirs of an Armenian Army Officer translated to English and    published by a member of American "Near East Relief Organization."    Gives the whole account of the genocide of all Turkish and Moslem    people in Armenia organized and executed by Armenian Government and    Army. Also gives account of countless other massacres and atrocities    against the Turkish people in Armenia.   2."Adventures in the Near East" by A. Rawlinson,     Dodd, Meade & Co., 1925     Eyewitness account of the same genocide by a British Army Officer.   3."World Alive, A Personal Story" by Robert Dunn,    Crown Publishers, Inc., New York, 1952     Another eyewitness account of the same genocide by an American     Officer.   4."From Sardarapat to Serves and Lousanne" by Avetis Aharonian,    The Armenian Review Magazine, Volume 15 (Fall 1962) through 17     (Spring 1964)     Memoirs of the chief Armenian delegate to the Paris Peace Conference    were published in the Armenian Review Magazine in 13 articles from    Volume 15 (Fall 1962) to Volume 17 (Spring 1964). These memoirs     include an interview between Aharonian and British Foreign Minister     Lord Curzon in which above-mentioned genocide was discussed. The     official report mentioned by Lord Curzon is the report of British     High Commissioner to Caucasia, Sir Oliver Wardrop.

Turkish children                       also should be killed as they form a danger to the                       Armenian nation.' (Hamparsum Boyadjian - 1914)[1]   [1] M. Varandian, "History of the Dashnaktsutiun," p. 85.   Source: Hovannisian, Richard G.: Armenia on the Road to Independence, 1918. University of California Press (Berkeley and Los Angeles), 1967, p. 13.  "The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the  area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were  Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.  Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third  of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the   Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia."   (See also Map 1. Historic Armenia and Map 4. Administrative subdivisions of   Transcaucasia).  In 1920, '0' percent Turk.   "We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as   ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work   of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village.   Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts   into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable   and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets   completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They   found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border   into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole   length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to   Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain   plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of   Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for   howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the   scattered bones of the dead."

Ultra-violet (by definition?) goes from the blue end of the spectrum that people see to the radio spectrum (X-rays, cosmic rays etc).  possibly you could get light at the fringe of visibility (which people with false eye-lenses can see easily, since it's your lenses that soak up most of the UV), however since most people use UV to get other things to `glow', and the near-blue is less energetic, it would probably not work as well, if it worked at all.

Just christians, muslims, jews...  Pardon me? Your ignorance cramps my conversation. Although the administrative  mechanism was a strictly centralized one, the Ottoman Empire 'was a classical  example of a pluralist social order.' The 'millet system' was the mechanism  which shaped the social order of the multi-national Ottoman Empire and stood  behind its continuity. As a matter of fact, because Islamic principles  were in force in the Ottoman Empire, it was natural to use religious  criteria to differentiate among the various communities which constituted  the Empire. The 'millet' system began to be based on ethnicity in the  19th century under the influence of nationalism. Sousa writes of the  existence of thirteen communities in the Ottoman Empire in addition to  the Muslim 'millet' in 1914. These were: (1) Greeks attached to the  Orthodox Patriarchate in Istanbul; (2) Catholics or Latins who were  remnants of Genoese and Venetian merchants; (3) Gregorian Armenians  attached to a Patriarchate in Istanbul; (4) Catholic Armenians; (5) Syrian  Catholics attached to a Patriarchate in Mardin; (6) Chaldean Catholics  attached to a Patriarchate in Mosul; (7) Syrian Jacobites attached to a  Patriarchate in Mardin; (8) Protestants; (9) Melchites attached to a  Patriarchate in Damascus; (10) Hebrews of two rites; (11) Bulgarian  Catholics attached to the Bulgarian Exarch; (12) Maronites; and (13)  Nestorians.[1] Scholars who studied the pluralistic social structure  outlined briefly above, concluded that the social order of the Ottoman  Empire fit the framework of the 'Mosaics Theory.'[2]   [1] N.

Most all from Audio >Control have them I know the C-101 does.      With regards to what you wrote, how does one "adjust for room dynamics  and stuff like that"?  I asked a professor that question just last week and he didn't really know himself.  Since pink noise is believed to be due to surface states (say, the surface of the Silicon where there's a lack of a covalent bond) that act as "traps" to nearby elecrons, and since this happens at low frequencies (because at high frequencies they aren't able to "trap" electrons), how do you compensate for that?  It seems to me that you wouldn't be able to compensate for pink noise.  I have seen the "pink noise" feature, however, on many EQs, and I was wondering how they are suppose to compensate for noise when pink noise is not due to "man made noise" like power lines, crosstalks, coupling, etc.  If you have any information about this, it would be appreciated.  Hope this didn't sound too drawn out.  Thanx.                                 - David (shorty@helios.nevada.edu)

What happened? 	1.  Potvin didn't let six goals by. 	2.  Wendel and Andreychuk woke up. 	3.  Home ice and LOTS of yelling in the Gardens gave the Leafs 		the emotional edge. 	4.  Refs calls (especially last night) tended to favour Leafs.  	A couple of comments:  	1.  On Gilmour:  Just because the guy isn't one of the three 	stars doesn't mean he was not leading the team.  Someone posted 	the playoff point total and he's in something like fifth or sixth 	place....plus, he walked away with the Molson cup (given for 	accumulating points from the three star selection) during the 	regular season.  	2.  On the officiating:  I've heard gripes from both ends on this 	one.  Emotions are very high in this series;  the rivalry is 	one of the stronger ones I know of.  I do have to agree that the 	officiating last night was pro-Leaf in general (except for whoever 	missed that slash on Gilmour's hand).  	3.  In general:  I STILL think Detroit has one of the better 	chances vs. Pittsburgh (though I think the Leafs would do better 	against the Blues....but not as well if they made it out of the 	division). Problem is, I like both these teams, though I'm 	supporting the Leafs on the underdog principle.  D  	By the way...Gilmour tiring out is a lot like Bob Probert not 		playing aggressive hockey....

I used to chuckle and snort over the silliness in that book and the absurdity of people believing in it as truth, etc.  Why do we spend so little time on the Mayan religion, or the Native Americans?  Heck, the Native Americans have signifigantly more interesting myths.  Also, what about the Egyptians.

Some wonder whether or not the moon could have ever supported an atmosphere.  I'd be interested in knowing what our geology/environmental sciences friends think.  As for human tolerances, the best example of human endurance in terms of altitude (i.e. low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure) is in my opinion to the scaling of Mt. Everest without oxygen assistance. This was accomplished by a team of mountaineers who trained at high altitudes for quite awhile (I think a few months) and then were flown by helicopter from that training altitude to the equivalent altitude on Mount Everest, where they began the ascent of our planet's highest peak without oxygen tanks.  This is quite a feat of physiological endurance, because if you or I tried to go to 20,000 feet and exert ourselves, we would probably pass out, get altitude sick, and could even die from cerebral edema. So this is the limit of low pressure.  High pressure situations would be limited by the duration of time which it takes to slowly acclimate to a higher pressure.  Skin divers would know alot about high pressure situations and could tell you about how they safely make deep dives without getting the bends.  Some military experiments have put people under several atmospheres of pressure (not sure what the high limit was because the papers aren't in front of me).  Usually at a certain point, the nitrogen in the air becomes toxic to the body and you start acting idiotic.  Divers call this nitrogen narcosis.  Those afflicted can do very dangerous and irrational things, like taking off a diving mask and oxygen tank in order to talk to fish at 100 feet under water.  (Hope any diving folk can elaborate on this matter, as I am not a diving expert).  Mars cannot support human life without pressurization because the atmosphere is too thin (1/100 th  our Earth's atmospheric density).  In addition, the Mars atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide.  Basically, you would need a  pressure suit there, or you'd die from the low pressure.  Interesting huh?  ken khayash@hsc.usc.edu

Questions to Israelis   To:  shaig@Think.COM  Subject: Ten questions to Israelis  Dear Shai,  Your answers to my questions are unsatisfactory.  In the answer to my first question, concerning the nonexistence of Israeli nationality, your answer conflicts with information I have received from other quarters, according to which there are two distinct categories of classifying Israelis:  Citizenship (Ezrahut) and Nationality (Le'um). The former is used on passports etc, and the later for daily identification in Israeli society. I am told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all times and present them at many public places, almost every day. These ID cards make clear who the holder is, a Jew or an Arab. You maintain that this mainly because of religious services provided. But do you really believe that this is the reason ? Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it serves no other purpose ?  In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that Israel has no fixed borders, you state that Israel's borders were 'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'. According to what I read, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into Transjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of Ben-Gurion to not declare Israel's borders, when Israel was established, as this might restrict Israel's opportunities for later expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the fact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the land to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God promised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the borders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use today ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can't it declare what it considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a base for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a number of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).  Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public official. I don't think your answer is honest.  You refer me to Vanunu's revelations about Israel's nuclear arsenal without evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said the truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why should he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.  Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning 'hidden prisoners' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from Ma'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do exist in Israel. What do you think about that ?  You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a way to 'cast aspersions upon Israel'. Such terms have often been used by the Soviet Union against dissidents: They call the Soviet Union into disrepute. If my questions are not disturbing, they would not call forth such hysterical answers. My questions are clearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts. I would be very happy if you could convince me that what I am told about Israel were just fabrications, but alas you have failed to do so. I suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest discussion. This is a sign of weakness, not of strength.  I hope you will muster the courage to seek the full truth.

However, the Mac SE cannot DISPLAY grayscale on  The original poster (W G Wright) posted an item saying that he had bought a new wizz-bang Laser Printer from Apple (a Select 300 I think) which can print GrayScale. He then said that he CANNOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer (and also that all the 'experts' he has dealt with agree that it is not possible).  This is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade (compared to Apple's SE to SE/30 upgrade): you will never be able to run Color Quickdraw. It is Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale.  SEs CAN print some COLOUR: this is because Quickdraw - the original, non-colour version, has the right hooks for eight colours. Some of you will remember the 'SCSIgraph' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE (I think that it gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something).  There is no reason that Apple couldn't release software patches for older computers (there are lots of Mac Pluses, Classics and SEs that have been upgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to deal with Color Quickdraw) - but they wont, and 3rd parties are having a difficult  time in duplicating the Mac's ROMs (i.e. Nutek et al.).  Just one Caveat: I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer, that you would be able to do so, whatever Mac you were using. (And I am pretty sure that the Select 300 is NOT a POSTSCRIPT printer [? correct me if I'm wrong?]).  Phil Ryan Melbourne, Australia

Hello duo owners (and Apple technical people :-)   I have a new duo 230 which appears to have a problem waking up from sleep when running on battery power. When woken (usually for the second time) after sleeping, the wake fails and the screen appears with a corrupted image of broken horizontal lines and control can only be recovered with control-command-poweron or the reset key at the back of the machine. The problem occurs even when the system is stock standard (no extensions, no virtual memory, a fully charged new battery, system 7.1 etc). I have not had the problem when the machine is plugged in to AC. I've checked that the battery is properly seated (it appears to be fine).   What's going on here ? Anyone else had this problem ? Is it software or hardware ?    If you have a duo 230 and a bit of time, try repeatedly sleeping and waking the machine on battery power and let me know if you see the same behaviour (and let Apple know too !).   Many thanks to anyone who can clear this one up for me.

I say Californians should form armed block clubs that would engage in coordinated strategies should BATF attempt to disarm them based on the "nefarious tipster" theory of law enforcement. Unlike Waco,  Californians should be able to destroy armored vehicles in city streets with incendiary weapons, acetylene after slowing them down with abandoned car blockades. M-1 Garands should easily outclass BATF shock troops with their H&K MP-5 SMGs, and there should be enough Sony Walkmans and Boom Boxes to overwhelm any FBI psy-war operation... yes, a good time would be had by all. Billary Clinton would get what he wanted, a War on Gunowners, the BATF would attempt to show the anti-gun press they they really, REALLY were in charge with a 500-man "Charge of the Light Brigade," and the FBI would attempt  to show how _THEY_ really were in charge by asking the Californian  National Guard to level the area with artillary!  :-) :-) :-)

Pocklington has chosen this moment to make his "last" stand is because he is at the moment of maximum advantage...the provincial government is months away from a provincial election...it is the moment when he has maximum power to convince Northlands to give him a better arena deal or a better purchase price... and it is before the NHL's new collective agreement with the players which might involve some enhanced revenue-sharing.  Pocklington is many things...stupid is not one of them.  He can dictate terms...because other cities will pay his price if Edmonton doesn't.  Edmonton has already fucked up its international airport, and surrendered supremacy to Calgary, and over the next few years Edmonton is going to take a hard hit from government cutbacks. It will screw itself beyond recogniton if it manages to find a way to lose its hockey team too...because Northlands wants to continue to use the Oilers to subsidize horse racing.  However, in this case, about the long-term financial viability of the Oilers, the fact is that Pocklington is basically  right, regardless of who owns the team, and it is right to provoke the crisis now, before the team accumulates millions of dollars in losses, or becomes habitually uncompetitive because of lack of money.  Sather has done his job...the Oilers are poised to be competitive again very soon (Al Strachan, one of the most knowledgeble hockey writers in Canada in a post-mortem of the Oilers season in the Globe and Mail recently agrees with me.)

If we say that He never hears the prayers of any who have sinned, we make pointless all prayers by anyone born less than 19 centuries ago.  But if we consider the prayers of the impenitent sinner, of someone who says, "Lord, I want you to do this for me, but don't expect me to change my way of life," that is a different matter. Even here, I would not venture to say that God never grants such petitions (just as He sends sun and rain on the evil and on the good). However, if someone we know well is praying to God in that spirit, we might have the responsibility to say, "Remember, if God's help is real, then so are His commands."   Yours,  James Kiefer

I limit myself to *one* 'standard serving' of alcohol if I'm going to ride. And mostly, unless the alcohol is something special (fine ale, good wine, or someone else's vsop), I usually just don't drink *any*.  But then alcohol just isn't really important to me, mainly for financial reasons...

I have been having problems with a slightly different clutch problem on my 90 Prelude. See rec.autos.tech for more detail. My problem is a false engagement point below the actual one. It also seems affected by weather - it is most noticeable (and annoying) on damp or cold days. My dealer says he can't reproduce the problem - I think I'll just sell the car.  Jeff Goss

You can set up different config.sys and autoexec.bat commands for each user, and they just have to select their menu option on bootup.

Is this the joke of the month?   1. Your fascist grandparents exterminated 2.5 million Muslim people between 1914 and 1920.  2. Your Nazi parents fully participated in the extermination of the European Jewry during WWII.  3. Your criminal cousins have been slaughtering Muslim women, children and elderly people in fascist x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag for the last  four years.  The entire population of x-Soviet Armenia now, as a result of the  Genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people, are Armenians.   For nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people  lived on their homeland - the last one hundred under the  oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation. The persecutions culminated in 1914: The Armenian Government planned and carried  out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks  and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their  homeland. After one thousand years, Turkish and Kurdish lands  were empty of Turks and Kurds.   The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.  Today, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and  Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.  Today, x-Soviet Armenian government covers up the genocide perpetrated  by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against  humanity.  x-Soviet Armenian government must pay for their crime of genocide  against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations  to the Turks and Kurds.  Turks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands, to determine  their own future as a nation in their own homeland.  During the 78th Anniversary, we come once again reiterate the unity of the Muslim People, the timelessness of the Turkish and Kurdish Demands and the desire to pursue the struggle for that restitution - a struggle that unites all Turks and Kurds.  Today, we appeal to all Turkish and Kurdish people in the United  States and Canada to participate en masse in the Commemorative  Events, be they cultural, political or religious.

It was pointed out that XtAppInitialize() should never be called more than once.  This helped.  However, I am still having some problems.  Below is a new little test program that more closely models my real program.  In the actual program, I am writing a library, callable from any other program.  This means that the first time the lib function is called, it must initialize things, and after that, it should just use the old stuff (still around because of static variables).  In the demo below, main() represents the main program calling my library and doit() represents the interface to the library function.  #include <X11/Xlib.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include <Xm/PushB.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h>  void bla(XtAppContext app, Widget top) {         Widget topone = top;		// in real prog, these are member vars         XtAppContext theapp = app;	// of a class         int junk = 0;         Display *dis = XtOpenDisplay(theapp, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, &junk,                                         NULL);          Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget("blaaa", xmPushButtonWidgetClass,                         topone,                         XmNheight, 50,                         XmNwidth, 50,                         NULL);          XtRealizeWidget(topone);         for (int i=0;i<=25;i++)	// real prog returns when "Exit" button clicked         {                 XEvent event;                 XtAppNextEvent(theapp, &event);                 XtDispatchEvent(&event);         }         XtDestroyWidget(box);         XtCloseDisplay(dis); }  // SetItUp - should be called once only void SetItUp(XtAppContext *app, Widget *top) {         int junk = 0;         (*top)=XtAppInitialize (app, "test", NULL, 0, &junk, NULL,                 NULL, NULL, 0); }  // doit - some library function callable from the outside void doit() {         static XtAppContext app;	// use these every time called         static Widget top;          static int setup = 0;          if (!setup)         {                 SetItUp(&app, &top);                 setup = 1;         }         bla(app, top); }  // main - program which links to my library main() {         for (int i=0;i<=20;i++)         {                 doit();                 printf("sleeping...\n");//widget still on screen at this point                 sleep(5);         } }   The problem is that the widget does not go away until the new one is created.

Let's say you even trust the escrow houses -- one is > the ACLU and the other is the EFF.  (And I'm not entirely joking about > those two names)  The problem with "Let's assume" reasoning is that, taken to the extreme (and you're close), you arrive at "Let's assume this is perfectly OK."  The assumptions you make are big ones. If the system is really secure, then why does the government have to keep the algorithm secret?  There are plenty of encryption algorithms that don't depend upon nondisclosure to be secure, so why in the world use one that does?  There are reasons, of course, but I certainly can't think of any honest ones.  Next, you assume we can "trust" the escrow houses. But the last time I checked, EVERY SINGLE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT has experienced unauthorized disclosure, corruption, and even fabrication, of supposedly secure data. The govt is saying "Yeah, but NOW we're serious, so you can trust us."  Bullcrypt.   And finally, although you didn't state it explicitly, you implicitly assume that the warrant mechanism in this country is safe and reasonable. The case in Ventura County of a man shot and killed by officers serving a deliberately fraudulant warrant tells me that the govt has a long ways to go on this score.  Remember that all this is to catch the drug dealers, right?  As others have pointed out, the current proposal will, if deployed, render truly secure encryption much more expensive and inconvenient than Uncle Sam's brand. Who will be able to afford, and be sufficiently motivated, to purchase this expensive, inconvenient higher protection?  Somebody with lots of extra cash...  The following is more true than ever:    "When [strong] encryption is outlawed, only outlaws will have [strong] encryption."   ________________________________________________________________________ | Mel beckman                  |   Internet: mbeckman@mbeckman.com     | | Beckman Software Engineering | Compuserve: 75226,2257                | | Ventura, CA 93003            |  Voice/fax: 805/647-1641 805/647-3125 | |______________________________|_______________________________________|  "You can observe a lot just by watching."  -Yogi Bera

I can't figure out if I should buy one here for later study or wait until I get back to the U.S.  Something I find interesting about studying theology in Germany is the fact that the students get their ancient language-learning out of the way early [I'm not a theology student, but I spend a lot of time with such folks] in their careers.  They take the first two years or so to just do Greek and Latin and Hebrew [possibly Aramaic, too--who knows]. What's it like at divinity schools or seminaries in the States?  Is there a lot of language instruction done?  I really don't have a basis for comparison.

So how much mass is saved by not burning the OMS?  That's the critical question. My data shows that the OMS engines hold 10,900 kg of propellant.  Of that, a  substantial fraction is going to be used for the first OMS burn, the reentry burn and the reserve.  So Pat, tell us how much fuel the altitude change is going to take, and how much the EDO pallet, BUS-1 and extra parts are going mass.  If you can make the numbers work out, _then_ I'll be interested.

First, while astronauts certainly have done EVAs with minimal planning, that was because they _had_ to.  They don't like to do that as a general rule.  Second, remember why they had to improvise during Intelsat 6?  They were trying to attach a motor to a piece of hardware that wasn't designed to do that.   Trying to shortcut the training is only going to make a repeat more likely.  Third, they don't have eight months.  They have however much time is left  after someone comes up with a plan, shows it can work and gets it approved. You may think I have a pessimistic attitude.  I think it's realistic.  I'm not saying that the engineering task is impossible (few engineering tasks are).

I had never met this doctor before, and she did not know what I was there for. As soon as I arrived, somebody showed me to an examining room and handed me a gown. They told me to undress (from the waist down, to be exact) and wait for the doctor. Is this the usual drill when you go to a doctor for the first time? I don't have much experience going to doctors (knock on wood), but on the couple of occasions when I've gone to a new doctor, I met him with my clothes on. First, he introduced himself, asked what I was there for and took a history, all before I undressed.   Are patients usually expected to get naked before meeting a doctor for the first time? Personally, I'd prefer to meet the doctor on something remotely resembling a condition of parity and to establish an identity as a person who wears clothes before dropping my drawers. If nothing else, it minimizes the time that I have to spend in the self conscious, ill at ease and vulnerable condition of a person with a bare bottom talking to somebody who is fully clothed.   Does anybody besides me regard this get-naked-first-and-then-we-can-talk attitude as insensitive? Also, is it unusual?     James Arbuckle                          Email:  v5113e@vm.temple.edu

Andrew Kille writes:  >Are you suggesting that God supports genocide? >Perhaps the Germans were "punishing" Jews on God's behalf? >  >Any God who works that way is indescribably evil, and unworthy of >my worship or faith.  The Bible does tell us that governments are ordained by God (Romans 13).  And furthermore, God foreknows everything that would happen.  It is just to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds, the inevitablity of the sucess of God's plan, and this is especially hard to grasp when we see governemnts doing evil.  However, though they are doing evil (and we should not cooperate with them when they do such), it must be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead to the final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as is possible.  In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in the eyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just deserts now rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killing people for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, and Annias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that His plan might be accomplished.     But don't forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to execute His just judgement upon another.  The Romans were used to fulfill the chorus of "Let his blood be upon our hands" of the crowd in Jersualem.  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel, which was inturn gotten by Persia, etc.  God does use nations to punish other nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament.  Don't you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, "Mene, mene, tekel, peres?"  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God's justice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persians as their due punishment for their rebellion.  Another exammple is the extirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel.  The Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, and the Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly.  I could go on with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point is quite clear. Two things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us to question why God has ordered the world as He has.  In His divine Wisdom, He made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans 9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter.  2) The message of Jesus Christ is as follows: "Repent now, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand."  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - "Let the dead bury the dead, come, follow me."  There is not an infinite amount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people to follow Him and become fishers of men.  He does not say, "well, alright, you can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your plans."  He said "Follow me."  His message is NOT "I'm just a sweety-pie who would never hurt a fly, you've got all the time in the world, and Divine Judgement, that's only a fairy tale."  "Our great God and Savior" Jesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of the world.  And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be questioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy.  D. Andrew Byler "Does not He who ways the heart perceive [sin], and will He not judge men according to their works?" - Proverbs 24.12

(From the Windows Resource Toolkit (for Win4Workgroups)), add an entry to your "system.ini" file under the [NonWindowsApp] section:      CommandEnvSize=NNNN  "This sets the COMMAND.COM env size, where NNNN must either be 0 or between 160 and 32768.  A value of 0 disables the setting.  If this value is too small or too big, it is rounded up to 160 or down to 32768. If the value is less than the current size of the actual environment, this setting is disabled, as if it were 0.  If you specify the environment size in a PIF file for COMMAND.COM, the PIF setting overrides this setting.  The default is 0 with MSDOS versions earlier than 3.2.  Otherwise, the default value is the /e: option in the SHELL= command in CONFIG.SYS.  To set this value, you must edit your SYSTEM.INI [and reboot]."   I have used this entry, as well as relied on the default /e: from the CONFIG.SYS shell= line, and both give larger environments.  If you don't use one of these, then the environment passed by windows to each new DOS box is just a little bit bigger than the environment _variables_ present when windows was started.  (No matter how big the DOS env was, when windows starts, it truncates all unused space except for a few bytes.)  This should allow your batch file to run, but your mileage may vary.  -- Jerome (Jerry) Schneider             Domain: jls@atg.COM  Aspen Technology Group               UUCP:   {uunet}!csn!atglab!jls PO Box 673, Ft.

I'll take a try at this...  From the discussions I have been in, and from how *I* have interpreted the bible, I feel that one can pray either way.  BUT remember this, before Jesus, the people talked to God (no other way) and he talked  back.  (audible and dreams, etc.)  Today we have the bible to know  Gods will, and we have his son you died for US.  He was given as our savior, and while we still do things according to Gods will, we pray THROUGH his son.  In the bible it says that if we are not known to  Jesus, we are not known to God.  (sorry I do not have the verses with me)  So, if we are to be granted eternal life, we must present ourselves to Jesus first, who will then present us to God.

Being "frightening" isn't a crime.  Some people are afraid of young Black males.  That doesn't make the mere status of being a young Black male a crime.  The BATF itself admitted leading off by throwing handgrenades.  There is no evidence that they properly identified themselves as law enforcement  personnel.

Of course that hasn't stopped them from making other such spurious charges, such as the existence of mythical "meth labs".

Instead of holding an auction, I have decided to compute prices for each comic (after many suggestions).  These are the most reasonable prices I can give (not negotiable).  If you would like to purchase a comic (or group), simply email me with the title and issue #'s you want.  The price for each issue is shown beside each comic.  First come, first served!!!  There is no more bidding.  Meet my price and it is yours.  I can be reached at this email address:  02106@chopin.udel.edu or 02106@ravel.udel.edu or 02106@bach.udel.edu or 02106@brahms.udel.edu  NO MORE HAGGLING ABOUT THE PRICE!!!!!!!! LOTS OF COMICS FOR $1, $2, or $3 LOOK AT LIST!!!!!  Shipping is $2 for 1-3 comics.  For more than 3, the price will be determined by the volume of the purchase (I may have to use a big heavy box for large orders which costs more to mail).  For all those who have bought comics from me, thanks!!!  All comics are near mint unless otherwise noted (my books were graded by mile high comics and other comic professional collectors, not me!)

Plus it offers a full range of resolutions, high  refresh rates as well as unique proprietary performance features.   The card is available in both 16-bit ISA bus and 32-bit VESA Local  bus versions (models 8500 AND 8500VL).         With 1MB DRAM on board, the WINDOWSVGA 24 card offers  maximum resolution up to 1,280 x 1,024 and supports a refresh rate  of 72Hz at 800 x 600 and resolution up to 1,024 x 768  non-interlaced. Both models provide performance many times greater  than standard SVGA boards, yet conform to all current video  standards.         WINDOWSVGA 24 features Genoa's FlickerFree(tm) technology,  which eliminates screen flash and flicker to make viewing much more  comfortable.  the cards also come with Safescan(tm), a utility  developed by Genoa to eliminate the black border around the screen  and thereby provide 100-percent screen use for overscanning monitors.         WINDOWSVGA model 8500VL takes full advantage of the speed  offered by the new VESA Local bus technology.  Most VL bus cards  will only handle data transfers up to 33MHz, but the 8500VL will  transfer data at the full speed of the CPU, up to 50MHz.  Genoa is  also offering this card in the "TurboBahn" combination packaged  with their TURBOEXPRESS 486VL motherboard.         Built around the Cirrus Logic GD-5426 GUI accelerator,  WINDOWSVGA 24 offers the user an exceptional price/performance  value.  Genoa's advanced proprietary drivers act to "turbocharge"  the chip, thereby providing an affordable accelerator card with  power and performance that surpass many of the more highly priced  chip cards.  The Genoa user will enjoy optimal speed and  reliability for such programs as Windows, AutoCAD, AutoShade, 3D  Studio, OS/2, OrCAD and more.  Driver updates and product bulletins  are available on Genoa's BBS at (408) 943-1231.         Genoa Systems manufactures and markets an extensive line of  graphics adapters, motherboards, audio and multimedia cards for  IBM-compatible personal computers.  All products come with a two  year limited warranty on parts and labor.  Genoa products are  currently distributed worldwide through authorized distributors,  resellers, VARs and systems integrators.

In the Jewish tradition you are incredibly wrong!  They originate in the Torah and with Jewish ancestors, specifically the Patriarch Abraham (z"l).  That knowledge was sent East to India and China when Abraham gave "gifts" (the commentators to Jewish scripture say this was the knowledge of the occult arts) to all the rest of his children when he sent them away to the East.  This assured that Isaac only, who remained with Abraham, would inherit his most important spiritual gifts, what eventually became Judaism.  So you see, other religions can have very parochial views too.  By the Jewish view, you are very mistaken, your scripture are not scripture, your gods are not gods, your practices a jumble of errors that lead people to idol worship and away from God.  That doesn't stop us from respecting you to the extent of not trying to convert you or proselytize you and being willing to dialog in a respectful manner.  We're content to let you live the way you care to live as long as you leave us be.  We are happy to co-exist as long as you give us the same right.  But your incredible rudeness and violent nature seems to preclude that. Too bad.  Is this typical of your religion?  >However, there is one difference between the "newage" practitioner and >the actual follower of the Vedic teachings: the typical "newager" >desires to acquire all the material powers and opulences mentioned in >the Vedas, without referring to their source, the Lord.

In other words, he is just plain selfish.   You are a most presumptuous fellow!  How dare you presume that the "typical" New Ager doesn't acknowledge God and is selfish.  What trite, self-righteous, ego-ful garbage!  There are Buddhists, Christians, Jews, and those of many other religions here on this newsgroups for whom your words are simple slander.  > ...The Vedic >follower, on the other hand, knows that no matter what one desires, one >must worship God.

Well, Panos, Mr. Tamamidis?, the way you put it it is only the Turks who bear the responsibility of the things happening today. That is hard to believe for somebody trying to be objective. When it comes to conflicts like our countries having you cannot blame one side only, there always are bad guys on both sides. What were you doing on Anatolia after the WW1 anyway? Do you think it was your right to be there? I am not saying that conflicts started with that. It is only not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering. It is sad that we (both) still are not trying to compromise. I remember the action of the Turkish government by removing the visa requirement for greeks to come to Turkey. I thought it was a positive attempt to make the relations better.  The Greeks I mentioned who wouldn't talk to me are educated people. They have never met me but they know! I am bad person because I am from Turkey. Politics is not my business, and it is not the business of most of the Turks. When it comes to individuals  why the hatred? So that makes me think that there is some kind of brainwashing going on in Greece. After all why would an educated person  treat every person from a nation the same way? can you tell me about your  history books and things you learn about Greek-Turkish encounters during your schooling.  take it easy!   -- Tankut Atan tankut@iastate.edu  "Achtung, baby!"

I am thinking about buying an external monitor for my SE/30 and was wondering if anyone out in netland has any advice for me. 	I am mostly thinking about a 14" color monitor and an 8 bit card that can switch between 640*480 and something higher (like 800*600).  I read an old report on a card from Lapis that could do this, but could not use the external monitor as the main screen (with menubar) which to me is a major draw- back.  Has this perhaps been fixed? Or can any other cards do this (like the Micron Xceed) ? 	Also which monitor should I buy?  At the moment I am leaning towards the Sony 1304, 1304s or 1320 (what exactly is the difference between these?) but are there any other good cheap monitors I should know about?  Doesn't the monitor have to be multisync to support cards that can switch resolutions?  Please send me e-mail and I'll summarize.  I would also greatly appreciate getting the e-mail addresses of any mail order companys that sell monitors or cards.  Thanks in advance  Eggert Thorlacius University of Iceland

We should all remember that if Nixon 	hadn't tried to cover up the misguided actions of some of his 	subordinates in the Watergate burglary, the scandal would 	never have brought down his presidency.

I can produce similar artifacts.  I am using a Centris 610 with an Apple 16" monitor.  I got the 8/230/CD configuration, so there is on-board ethernet and 1 Megabyte of video ram. The effect only occurs in 256 color and 256 grey modes.  Any vertical scrolling operation, whether with a scrollbar or, say, using vi and inserting lines, will produce a scattering of horizontal flickering lines on the screen. They do not persist -- each is visible for perhaps one refresh, and then that part of the screen is back as usual.  They seem to always start at or about the 64th pixel from the left, and are maybe 512 pixels wide.  This is certainly not preventing me from using my Macintosh ;-), but it does seem to be a sign of something perhaps grounded incorrectly in the video circuitry...   I went ahead and called the Apple Customer Assistance Center, at:   1-800-776-2333, or 1-800-767-2775 (more direct?)  The person who answered was polite :-).  I also took the chance to complain about my mouse button sticking, and about the mac hanging on boot after a (hard - killed MacsBug) crash which left a CD in the drive.

One study found that at some places at least, 1/6 of the women professed to be "Born Again".

The cable tv companies   even tried to stop amateur radio in switzerland in the beginning of cable   tv(they seem to be too stupid to know anything about international frequency   conferences or so). Even today, they use the cheapest possible coax running   into problems they can't solve anymore. As Bill noted, the only way is to look   for a solution with the neighbours *BEFORE* calling for the cable tv guys or   the fcc. The chance to find neighbours with some sense for reason is by far   bigger than with these people (especially the first ones). As anywhere in an   administration people don't like, if You tell them to work for the money they   get... The problem is, that radio amateurs don't have the power to put trough their   rights in all cases. So let's hope they start soon with optical fibers and get   out of our freqencies.

No platoon advantage (Sabo vs. Samuel).  Both players have a reputation of being excellent fastball hitters, 	and both have a reputation of being fooled too often with 	slow curves and change ups.  Sabo has more power, and a little bit of a better batting eye.  Samuel 	is noted as an agressive free-swinger.  Sabo has more homerun power.  Both players started the game hitting below .200.    There may have been some game considerations that might have prompted 	Perez to want to reserve Samuel for use later.  But the game 	*was* on the line, and Samuel never did get in.  Given all of this, I don't see a lot to suggest pinch-hitting, nor do I see anything to suggest no pinch-hitting.  There is, of course, the clutch-hitting information.  But if that's useless...

Was the crucification the will of God or >a tragic mistake.  I believe it was a tragic mistake.  God's will can >never be accomplished through the disbelief of man.  I finished reading a very good book, "The Will of God", Weatherhead. This was very helpful to me in applying thought to the subject of the will of God.  Weatherhead broke the will of God into three distinct parts; intentional will, circumstancial will, and ultimate will.  He (Weatherhead) also refuted the last statement (above) by Michael Parkin above quite nicely.  Summarizing; _despite_ the failures of humankind, God's ultimate will is never to be defeated.  God's intentions may be interfered with, even temporarily defeated by the will of humankind, brought down by circumstance.  His ultimate will (the reconcilication of all humankind) will never be stopped.  Time after time, Weatherhead used the Cross as the best description of this process at work.  His points, paraphrased, were 1) God's intentional will was for Jesus, the Christ, to live out a full life and perform the work of the Living God.  2) The failures, sins, and deviousness of humankind frustrated God's intent for His Son.  3) Despite the circumstance, God's ultimate will was revealed in the Cross, as Jesus willingly ("not my will, Lord, but yours") died for the redemption of all humankind.  The Cross was utterly triumphant, overcoming even the most cruel of circumstances.  >this world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.

The  types of cells that vitamin A regulates are the general epithelial cells  and these cell types are not the ones that function in the ear hearing  process.  The hair cell nerve-like epithelial cells in the ear may respond  to vitamin A during cellular differentiation(embryogenesis) but I don't  know if they are still capable of responding in adults.  If they are  capable of responding with new hair growth, this would be a very major  breakthrough in hearing loss.  With all of the medical interest in vitamin  A, it would not be too surprising if a clinical study was done using  vitamin A to reverse hearing loss.  But with only a news announcement to go  on(and this type of communication is notoriously bad), I can't comment on  your question anymore than I already have.  If one study has been done,  more will need to follow to firm up a link between vitamin A and hearing  loss if there really is one.  Marty B.

Just because a fax modem behaves like a printer on a "local" machine, doesn't guarantee functionality  when a "local" machine has fax software printing to a "remotely installed" fax card.  I tried this with Workgroups and the  fax software didn't like it at all.  Could have been WinFAX's peculiarisms but I don't think so.  A lot of special hardware interaction takes place internally.  In my case, a FAX manager program merely "intercepts" the print job and spools it to it's own directory, not print manager's spool directory.  To software, it appears the job was "printed".  Print Manager  plays NO part in the handling of the actual process.  Pardon me if I've incorrectly assumed this is what you were up to.  A truely network-aware fax-modem will most likely be required, or a lot of weird setup and tinkering.  Good luck.

I don't believe you.  I am told (by the person who I care a lot about and who I am worried is going to start putting his health and money into homeopathy without really knowing what he is getting into and who is the reason I posted in the first place about homeopathy) that in Britain homeopathy is available on the National Health Service and that there are about 6000 GPs who use homeopathic practices. True? False? What?  Have there been any important and documented investigations into homeopathic principles?  I was reading a book on homeopathy over the weekend. I turned to the section on the principles behind homeopathic medicine, and two paragraphs informed me that homeopaths don't feel obliged to provide any sort of explanation. The author stated this with pride, as though it were some sort of virtue! Why am I sceptical about homeopathy? Is it because I am a narrow-minded bigot, or is it because homeopathy really looks more like witch-doctory than anything else?  Daniele.

That's why they're used.    Actually, I don't know know anyone who has actually gotten a "sugar pill". I don't know how it could be done, since prescription drugs are always labeled, and it's easy enough to find out what's in a pill if you have the name.

Anybody got 'em???         I thought the Motor Voter bill passed.         In any case, my experiance with Tennessee's voter registration system (which you can register with by mail, by the way) is that nobody who is interested in voting is being denied access to registration. All it requires is just the tiniest bit of interest on the registrant's part and thinking about the election once in the eleven months prior to it.  (Once you register it's good unless you miss for years worth of elections of move.)         It's easy to register now.  I simply don't see the value in going out and trying to get people registered who don't have enough gumption to even write and have the proper forms sent to them.   How can we expect responsible decisions out of these people?  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ David Veal Univ. of Tenn. Div. of Cont. Education Info.

Look, I don't want to bore everybody here with the physics of woodstoves, but they're not anything like your Caloric gas range.  It takes about three hours for a woodstove to get hot enough to cook on, and afterwards  you can't just "shut it off" -- it will contain hot embers for over 24  hours even after you choke it COMPLETELY.

If you're seeking validation for your philosophy on the strength of  the national health service adopting it, I suggest that you are not very  sure of the validity of your philosophy.

The card is a VL-BUS card which can display 16.7 million colours in 640x480 mode with 1MB DRAM.  It comes with ET4000/W32 window drivers and a normal Et4000 drivers. The ET4000/W32 drivers handles, 640x480, 800x600, 1024x786 in 256 colours. Also, in 640x480 and 800x600, it supports hicolor, 32K and 64K colours.  Here is my winmark result running on a 16MB 486DX33 EISA/VL-BUS system using Hint chipsets.  Winmark 3.11 from ZD lab.

For example, is this a public key system or a private key system? If the latter, then I don't see how the system could work (given that the keys are tied to the device and not the person).  Further, the escrowed 80-bit keys are split into two 40-bit chunks. I would guess that the availability of one of these 40-bit chunks and a reasonable key-search machine, would allow you to read the traffic. I'm not suggesting that this is a deliberate weakness of the system, but it does make you think. Of course, this is easily fixable by  giving out two 80-bit chunks which could be x-ored to generate the  real 80-bit key.  Philip

I don't know about sys 7.1, but at least on 6.0.7, there are bugs in the Sound Manager that causes channels to hang (with no error message). This happends when I keep a channel open for long periods - necessary for performance - and play many sounds, stopping sounds halfway. Callbacks seems not to be reliable. Then only way I can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to inspect private variables in the channel (QHead, I think it was), and the only way I have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an *undocumented* flag and modify it.  Am I happy with this? Nope. I consider writing to SoundBase simply to get rid of the bugs.  Any better suggestions?

A capacitor kludged in somehow, etc?  I've got a microcontroller that is running a bunch of valves and pumps in a big instrument washer, and almost everything is being switched with zero-crossing solid state relays, so that stuff stays "quiet", AC-wise. But there's one steam valve that gets turned on by a mechanical relay in the water tank fill/thermostat system, and it's not under control of my SSRs, and it does sometimes generate/radiate a spike that resets one of my peripheral chips.  My software times out and tries again, but I'd love to just tack in a magic spike-killing fix that would avoid having to do some major rewiring/redesign.  A varistor would help but might not be sufficient.

As I stated, religion  There are various contradictory views on the origin of the Armenians. The name is to be found in the Darian inscriptions in the form 'Armina' or 'Aramaniya' is to be found in the inscription on the Bistun monument. The following references to the Armenians are to be found in the Bistun cuneiform inscription of Dara Vishdasb (510 B.C.).   1. The monarch Dara said: I sent my servant to Arminam 'Armeniya'.   6. On reaching Arminam 'Armeniya'.   7. To the country town of Zozo, to Armaniya 'Armeniya'.  According to Karakashian:  As for 'Armenia', the equivalent of the 'Armin' or 'Arminik' of the Persians, this is more recent than the word 'Ararat', and is to be found used in the Dara inscriptions for 'Haiastan'.    Saint Martin:  The name 'Armenie' has been given since very early times by almost all the various eastern peoples to the territory referred to by the Armenians as 'Haiastan'. It was known to the Syrians as Armenia and to the Arabs as Ermeniyye.   Others believe that Urartu was known in the time of the Medes as 'Harminap' which was later modified by the Persians to 'Arminia'. 'Ar' refers to a place, as in Ararat, Archish, Aruyr, Archar, Arshav, Arazen and Aror,  while 'men' is used to refer to spirit, thought or human being, and  therefore 'Armen' would appear to signify 'the people of that place'.  G. Alishan believes that 'according to our national vocabulary "Haik" is the diminutive form of "Hai", and that "Hai" is the name of our nation. Our nation is in no way connected with the word "Armen" that foreigners apply to our people.'  It would thus appear that 'Armenia' is a place-name, that 'Armen' is  the name of the people who lived there, and that these are in no way connected with the word 'Hai'.  Haik and Haiastan:  Armenian historians believe Haik to have been a great hero from whom the Armenian people took the name 'Hai'. But the mere resemblance between the words 'Haik' and 'Hai' constitutes no real proof, and, in any case, no such theory appears before the time of Moses of Khoren.  Haiasa:  The following studies show quite clearly that 'Hai' and 'Haiasa' were no more than general names used by the Hittites to refer to the  region known as Armenia.  Professor Hachadurian: 'Haiasa was the general name used in Hittite inscriptions for Upper Armenia.'  Yensen, in his 'Hittites and Armenians' tries to prove that 'Hai' is identical with the Hittite 'Hatio', in other words that 'Hai' is a Hittite word. Research, however, has proved this erroneous, and shown that 'Hai' was derived from 'Hatio'.  Mortman's attempt to read the Urartu inscriptions as Armenian met with  no success. As for Greek, there is no point in even mentioning it.  The resemblance between the words 'Haiasa' and 'Haiastan' is so obvious that we may well accept 'Haiasa' as the oldest form of 'Haiastan'.  Let us now cast a brief glance on how the words 'Hai', 'Haikazan' and 'Haiastan' entered our older works.  According to Karakashian:   'The word "Haik" is never to be found employed with reference to a leader of the Armenian people prior to Moses of Khoren, nor is it ever found employed in the forms "Haika" or "Haykazn".  Agahangelos and Puzant use the word as a title or a place-name (he improved and developed Haiastan, etc.). If the word had referred to a nation and had been derived from "Hai" or "Haik" they could  also have used the words "Haikak" and "Haykazn" in a number of places.'  According to Professor Sayce, who deciphered a number of Hittite  inscriptions:  'In the Hittite language the suffix -ha is used to specify quality or species. The words "Haddanas", "Haddina" were used by the  Assyrians to refer to the Hittites. With the transformation of the "d" between the two "a" letters to "y" "Hadinasdani" was in this way transformed to "Haiastan"'.  Professor Grechmer fully agrees with this point of view, but regards the significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms 'Hai' and 'Haistan' as quite unsatisfactory. He finds, however, that a  solution to this problem is brought nearer by the name 'Haiasa'  which is so frequently found in Bogazkoy from 1400 B.C. onwards. Forrer takes 'Haiasa' as referring to Upper Armenia. In that case it seems likely that 'Haiasa' was actually a part of Armenia. The suffix -dan is of Anatolian origin. The real root is 'Hayasa', which refers to the country of the 'Hayasas'.  E. Chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological  and Anthropological characteristics of the Armenian people.  The Armenians in Russia may be characterized as follows: Almost all of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic, very dark, above average height, an Aissores Asian group with close ties with certain Kurdish tribes and Azerbaijan peoples.  According to J. Deniker:  From the philological point of view, the Armenian and Kurds may be regarded as belonging to the Iranian group...The Armenians are  descended from various elements and from a very mixed race. Their average height varies between 1.63 and 1.69 according to the region. They are almost always short-headed, with skull measurements of  85-87. As a race they belong to the Indo-Afghan-Assyrian-Turkic family.  Professor Rene Vernont writes as follows:  The Armenians are a mixture of Semites, Turk, Kurds and Mongols, but some of them display Armenian features, e.g., height a little above average, fair complexion, dark hair, dark eyes, very often a hooked nose and a rather wide mouth.   Investigations carried out by N. Kossovitch on the links between Armenian blood groups and their anthropological characteristics led him to the conclusion that the Armenians did not form a  distinct race.  Serdar Argic                             'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                              might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                              and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'                                                   (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)                            'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists                              a single Turkish soul.' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)

We do some calculations based on the image of the hole on the screen.  However, the calculations are mathematically highly complex, and must assume that the object's hole projects an image (resembling an ellipse if the tube is not parallel to the screen) in the centre of the screen.  However, it is unlikely that the object is placed so conveniently.    Firstly, we must transform the major and minor axis of the ellipse.  I cannot know what the angle between the tube and screen is.  Do I have to assume that they are parallel to do the transformation?  How do I do this transformation?  Secondly, there is a distortion of the image due to the screen being planar (the source--screen distance increases as we move away from the centre of the screen).  How can I compensate the ellipse's axis for this image distortion?  So, please can anyone give us a few pointers here?  How do we transform the image so it appears as it would if it were in the centre of the screen, and how do I deal with distortion due to the shape of the screen?  We'd appreciate any help, either posted or emailed.

It can be easily inferred  from the facts on the ground and from the information  provided by the Hebrew press. There is one condition,  though. The torrents of claptrap about "the peace  process" must be totally ignored, as must Israel's official  pronouncements, whole sole purpose is to distort reality.  By concentrating only on the facts, it was early apparent  that Labour's policies were no different from those of  Shamir but for their greater reliance on deceit and their  more effective implementation.  Likud's policies were accurately described by Ariel  Sharon in an article, accompanied by a map, in Yediot  Aharonot last August. The Sharon plan envisaged a  division of the West Bank into seven, and the Gaza Strip  into four, "autonomous" Palestinian enclaves, all of them  under Israeli supervision. The total area of these  enclaves amounted to about 15 per cent of the  territories. The rest was to be controlled by the Israeli  settlements and the highways built around the enclaves.  The entire area around Jerusalem, from the outskirts of  Ramallah to the boundaries of Bethlehem, has already  been turned into a "Greater Jerusalem" where the Arab- inhabited localities amount to small enclaves surrounded  by areas occupied by Israeli settlements or reserved for  them.  Judging from Labour's settlement policy, it may be  assumed that it may content itself with a lesser number  of Arab enclaves of a rather larger size than Sharon had  planned. But the principle of surrounding the enclaves by  settlements strategically dispersed along the highways  remains unchanged. Labour plans only four enclaves in  the West Bank: two in "Samaria" and two in "Judea" (i.e.  north and south of Jerusalem respectively), and no more  than two in the Gaza Strip. In regard to "Greater  Jerusalem", Labour's policies hardly deviate from  Sharon's.  A saner version of Likud policy  As some Israeli correspondents at once realised, Labour  policies were but a saner version of Sharon's  extravaganza. Last July, Gideon Eshet wrote in Yediot  Aharonot that, while "barely a few months ago" Labour  supported the demand to freeze all construction beyond  the Green Line, "no specific decision to freeze  construction in the territories has been taken". And Uzi  Benziman wrote in Ha'aretz that "as far as can be judged  on the basis of the internal political discussions in  Jerusalem, Rabin intends to stick to Likud's ways".  The two biggest enclaves envisaged by Labour are  located in "Samaria". Therefore the belt of settlements  around the "Trans-Samaria Highway", designed to  separate those enclaves from each other, is of paramount  importance. According to the latest data, the percentage  of Israeli settlers in the entire West Bank population  (apart from East Jerusalem) is a mere 5.5 per cent. But  for the area around the "Trans-Samaria Highway", the  corresponding figure is almost 20 per cent, and it is  increasing steadily. The situation in the settlements of  the "Efrat Block" south of Jerusalem, designed to sever  the enclave around Bethlehem from the one around  Hebron, is pretty much the same. The "Efrat Block" is now  being connected with West Jerusalem by a highway.  The project is costly in the extreme, because the highway  is designed to bypass Bethlehem by a sequence of long  tunnels. The final decision to build this highway was  suspended until Rabin's return from his US visit in  March. The subsequent decision to renew its construction  can be seen as US approval for the enclaves plan as a  whole.  Process of impoverishment  The enclaves plan implies deliberate and steady  impoverishment of the Palestinians. This is well known  in Israel but ignored abroad by all who should be  concerned, including the PLO. In regard to the Gaza Strip,  the whole process was best described by Ze'ev Shiff in  Ha'aretz in March. He mentions having seen "a pamphlet  issued six years ago by the Civil Administration  forecasting the conditions in the Gaza Strip under Israeli  rule in 2000". His analysis deserves to be quoted  extensively:  "We continue to steal the Strip's water, even though its  quality deteriorates from year to year. We continue to  steal the Strip's tiny land resources, in order to found  there more and more settlements, as if we deliberately  want to make the inhabitants despair, and in their  despair think in termws of having nothing to lose. It is  by our own doing that the Strip's workers must now  spend travelling to their workplaces almost as much time  as they spend working. From the military point of view,  we have kept control of no more than half the Strip's  area at an increasingly exorbitant price in manpower and  resources. About a year before Moshe Arens left the  defence ministry, I heard him saying that we should  withdraw from the Strip come what may. His argument  was that Israel sinks into the Strip ever deeper and  deeper. He told me he had proposed this to Yitzhak  Shamir but he rejected it." Yitzhak Rabin rejects it too.  Enormous state support for the Qatif Block settlers can  also be cited as proof that the enclaves plan is being  implemented. The Qatif Block settlements, founded by  the first Rabin government of 1974-77, are intended to  divide the Gaza Strip into two separate enclaves. Efraim  Davidi of Davar had data showing how vital for Israeli  this enterprise is. "The Qatif Block is now producing 40  per cent of Israeli tomatoes destined for export, and a  substantial proportion of cut flowers." He also deals with  the subsidies the settlers receive, considerably  augmented by the present government. Owing to them,  housing units are cheap. The present government does  not spare efforts to recruit new settlers to the block.  "Any prospective settler will get a 95 per cent mortgage  for his house on top of a grant of 18,000 shekels  ($6,500)."  Such data shows that Israel's plans apply whether the  Palestinians of the Gaza Strip are allowed or forbidden to  work in Israel. The economic motivations were explained  by Danny Rubinstein in Ha'aretz in March:  "From the economic viewpoint Gaza could already be  sealed off hermetically and all the Strip's workers could  be barred from entering Israel...Even though accurate  data is hard to come by, it is indisputable that during the  last two years the numbes of Gazan workers arriving  daily to work in Israel has markedly decreased, from  80,000 in the mid'80s to 40,000 today. But the decrease  is not only due to restrictions imposed on entering Israel  from Gaza. It is also due to the drastic curtailment of  demand for Gazan labour in Israel. With unemployment  in Israel soaring and the construction of apartments  blocks virtually halted, the workers from Gaza are no  longer really needed..."  Gaza's total dependence  The entire economy of the Gaza Strip is totally dependent  on Israel. In recent years in the Gaza Strip there has  been an increase in sub-contracted work for Israeli  factories, mostly footware and textiles. Thousands of  small workshops, employing an average of four workers,  get their raw materials or unfinished products, together  with detailed working instructions, from Israeli factories.  Rubinstein attributes this development to the fact that  "the average wage in the Gaza Strip is merely 40 per cent  of that in the West Bank, which in turn stands at half the  average wage in Israel; and besides the Gazan employer  does not pay any social security for his employees." If  the average wage in the Gaza Strip is just a fifth of that  in Israel, the profits of Israeli factories and even of  Palestinian sub-contractors must be vast.  They are higher still when "a Gazan sub-contractor  provides labour to be performed at home, with the  family's help. The livelihood of tens of thousands of  Gazans depends on such sub-contracted work." Many of  them are women and children, paid about ten shekels  ($3.50) a day which can last 12 hours or more. There can  be no doubt that profits from exploiting cheap Gazan  labour are one of the reasons for the stubborn opposition  of Rabin and other Israeli ministers to withdrawal from  the Strip.  Economic conditions in the Gaza Strip differ little from  what was created straight after Israel's conquest [in  1967]. In this respect, one should not be deluded by the  talk, nowadays fashionable, about Israeli gestures  intended to "encourage economic development in the  territories", As Israeli journalists point out, all permits  for opening new businesses depend on a prior approval  by the Shin Bet. "Behind all the professed goodwill there  is no desire to solve problems, just the attitude of a good  colonialist, willing to do something for the benefit of the  natives, but on condition that they behave nicely, do not  become rebellious, and never do anything against the  interests of the metropolis, its economic interests  included," wrote Michal Sela in Davar in February. The  development of sub-contracted work in the Gaza Strip  accords perfectly with Sela's diagnosis.  Sela also shows how exactly the economic controls work.  "In all branches of the economy, lobbies have been set in  motion for purposes of freeing Israeli production from  the threat of any Palestinian competition. The method is  simplicity itself. As soon as any Israeli producer succeeds  in persuading the government, or even the trade and  industry minister alone, a military order is issued  prohibiting the export of a given produce to Israel. If this  does not suffice, a Palestinian factory may be denied a  licence to operate or bureaucratic obstacles may paralyse  its production." Among the most active of such lobbies is  the agricultural one. It has succeeded in limiting exports  of Gazan vegetables (except for those grown by settlers)  not only to Israel but also to Europe, where they  otherwise might compete with Israeli exports.  Perpetuaring apartheid  Labour's goal is to perpetuate this apartheid regime in  the territories. The same goal is shared by the US, which  otherwise could not support the Labour government so  firmly. In my view one of the reasons the US feels  happier about supporting Labour than Likud is its  greater efficiency in pursuing the settlement drive. This  point was brought home by Ofer Shelah in Ma'ariv, who  deplored the settlers' failure which he attributed to  Likud's inefficiency. he showed that the peak yearly  settlement growth "occured during the term of office of  the National Unity government (i.e. 1984-90) in which  Rabin served throughout as the defence minister".  Likud's reputation for settling the territories better than  Labour is false, attributable to the many tiny settlements  without strategic value founded under Shamir for  symbolic reasons.  To sum up: Labour's policy, unconditionally supported by  the US differs from that of Likud primarily in the  efficiency with which it is implemented. According to  that policy the territories are to be divided into two  parts. The major part is to be ruled by Israel directly,  and the minor part indirectly. In my view, this racist  scheme is doomed to ultimately fail, but at a horrifying  price in human suffering. The sooner its true nature is  recognised, the less suffering it may cause.  ************************************

Decima president Allen Gregg is considered one of the world's top poll researchers, and Mulroney's Conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in the face of impossible election situations.  I haven't had a chance to see this year's version due to our library, but previous ones before the Americans started their assault and disinformation had shown satisfaction at 97% and switching to an American all-private system had support within statistical noise.

Personally, I feel that the universal health insurance approach used in Canada, France and Germany -- paying to private health providers in a nominally free market not unlike America's, minus HMO's -- depends a lot on values in those societies different from the U.S.  The basic health needs for life are not viewed as market, but the insurance does allow the market to address that -- basic health care is not viewed on the level of ownership of a VCR as Americans would see it.

Actually, I find Limbaugh's oratory less than sizzling and his debating skills sometimes lacking, even though his conclusions are often correct.  I would suggest that a bankrupt leftist ideology that hopes to use concentrated  political power and a loaded gun to force everyone to do the "right" things (where "right" is defined by the elitist academics who lead the movement) is showing an acute case of "myopic social perspective", not to mention arrogance and utter stupidity.  Limbaugh is certainly far from perfect, but his opponents in the established body politic and the media are the ones arguing for Federal control of virtually all aspects of the lives of the Citizenry, and for the elimination of local control over Affairs Public.    Perhaps Limbaugh has a following because The People are tired of being treated  like errant children by a self-important group of arrogant controlling myopic  people who have no understanding of how life operates outside of the "oughta-be's" inside their own hopelessly closed minds.    >        The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening  >pages of both books.

(pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)  You neglect to mention that Mr. Limbaugh (have you ever listened to his show,  BTW?) continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves rather than blindly following any media icon, himself included.  You yourself mention  that he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions. He also adopts a rather satirical approach, and presumes his audience to be intelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness (and he says as much). This is in contrast to the average mass-media show, in which the audience is treated as society's intellectual lowest common denominator.  I am sure that Adolf Hitler was a master of satire; I am sure he was just kidding when he said that the Jews were the cause of Germany's problems and needed to be exterminated.    >On Religion as the Basis of a Nation >        Hitler: "In this world human culture and civilization are  >inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his  >decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without  >culture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord  >sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the  >expulsion from Paradise." (Page 581.)  This is not religion, it is clearly a perverse worship of race.  Since Christ was a Jew, it seems quite unlikely that Hitler's characterization of the Aryan as "the highest image of the Lord" fits with Christian doctrine.    >        Limbaugh: "America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ...  >But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or  >ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a  >charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools  >for the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of  >American education has declined ever since?" (pages 274-5.)  Private religious schools have a vastly better record of success than publicly funded schools.  American history is indeed primarily Judeo- Christian.  I suppose that Mr. Limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalent to Adolf Hitler worshiping the Aryan race.  I think you might be reaching just a wee bit here.    >On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse >        Hitler: "The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ...  >One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and  >theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ...  >Theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays  >must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the  >service of a moral idea of State and culture." (pages 346 and 348.)  Definite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment industry here.   >        Limbaugh: "Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that  >Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people  >who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality  >and monagamy. They disparage American heroes." (page 254.)  Just a guess here, but I don't think that Mr. Limbaugh would advocate government control of Hollywood.  You should perhaps call his radio show to confirm this.  I believe this is more a criticism of Hollywood and the depraved moral values it espouses, not an advocation of government control  of Hollywood.  90's Liberals, on the other hand, want to have complete government control  of our school systems, so that the government can teach The People at an early age the "right" way to view religion and morality.  I believe Mr.  Limbaugh is against this, as his satirical use of the "young heads full of mush" hyperbole indicates.    >On the News Meida >        Hitler: "The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of  >gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass  >by in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the  >people's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of  >slavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews." (Page 331.)  Pretty strong conspiracy theory insinuated here, with an implicit plea for government power to be used to break up the conspiracy.    >        Limbaugh: "Elements of The Media have jumped on the  >bandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been  >replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During  >the Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global  >network. We can't take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don't  >realize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that  >therefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided  >and, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania." (pages 270 and 268.)  Indication here that "Elements of the Media" (since career is a self-selected categorization, perhaps an inferred 'larger percentage than represented in the populace at large') has a leftist bias.  Doesn't sound too unreasonable. No insinuation that CNN should not report in an objective fashion, only that for reporters to say that they do not have any personal bias in the situation is disingenuous to megalomaniacal.  You may disagree, and it may well be exagerrated, but it is not an unreasonable  opinion; and Mr. Limbaugh goes well out of his way to make sure that his  audience knows that these are his opinions, unlike most other reporting that  purports to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree  or other, in a statistical sense, reflect the biases of the reporters.  Who  is being disingenuous here, Mr. Shaw or Mr. Limbaugh?  Again, you should ask Mr. Limbaugh himself, but I expect that he would oppose government control of the media.    >*     *     *          >To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but  >ultimately too depressing to take in one reading.  It is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome Liberal arrogance. Liberals love to play games with paradigms as a way of discrediting people who disagree with them.  Why don't you challenge conservative ideology on an intellectual level rather than engaging in ludicrous comparisons? Perhaps the underpinnings of your ideology are intellectual only in that they exist in your mind, not the real world.    >        After putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that  >haunts me.

Perhaps there are a few among the intellectually challenged who percieve Rush Limbaugh as a hate-monger, but in my experience he has been spreading laughter at the ludicrous self-importance of the Left, not hatred.  As to Mr. Bush, you may be correct about his fascist economic leanings. Mr. Reagan, on the other hand, did his best to reverse the fascist trend of government involvement in business.  Mr. Clinton is increasing fascism in America through "business/government partnership" and increased levels of taxation.  Perhaps you should not have skipped your vocabulary classes in grade school.    >        And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the  >radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. One can only  >wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on.  Hmmm.  Seems to me that Limbaugh is not in any way comparable to Hitler because he has not murdered six million Jews and many, many others out of racism.  I come from a mixed-race family, so I am quite well attuned to racism; I don't hear any coming from Rush Limbaugh.  The only place I hear  racism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the Liberal  Left.  The Liberal Left is the movement I see trying to get America hooked on the opiates of Socialized Medicine, Socialized Transportation, Socialized Education, etc.  The Left already has America hopelessly addicted to  that Liberal drug, the Social Security Chain Letter.  It is quite clear to me that while the Hitler analogy does not really apply to either Rush  Limbaugh or William Jefferson Clinton, if one of the two is closer than  the other it is clearly the Fascist Clinton.   >The Madison Edge can be reached at PO Box 845, Madison, WI 53701- >0845; (608) 255-4460. > >--- 30 ---  This is the same address as "Idiots Anonymous", isn't it?

If IDE speed come from IDA WHERE does the 8.3MB/s sighted for IDE come from?  SCSI is not complex. It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it. There are THREE key differences in SCSI; the controller chip, the port, and the software.  THAT IS IT. Let us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point.  SCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY}  asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s}  synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a  rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.}  SCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from  SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines.  In the Mac and some PCs  this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers  AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the   slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode   4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous  mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s}  SCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things  over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the  machine and the external device.  Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver  software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2.  Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst.  SCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this  requires: SCSI-2 driver software, wide SCSI-2 port, and that the RECIEVING  devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.  As expected this is VERY  expencive.  Speed: 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s bursts    As I said SIMPLE.  Seven versions of SCSI seperated by software, the  controler chip, and the port. Standarize the SOFTWARE and it DROPS to only FIVE versions of SCSI seperate by only HARDWARE {the chip and the port}

Not only are you moving data on a path twice as wide (at least), but there is a difference in the number of clocks required for bus transactions between the two busses.  Most ISA boards require multiple clocks per bus transaction -- typically this is around 3-4. EISA boards are suppose to be able to 'burst' at a 1:1 rate, so I would expect performance to be 6x-8x that of an ISA card.    So I guess, for me, the question is unanswered still.  I would expect him to be able to see a 6x speed difference, and he apparently does not.    --  "Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live  in the real world."   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Fred.McCall@dseg.ti.com - I don't speak for others and they don't speak for me.

I guess for DOS users who think multi-tasking is really _neat_ (add puke here) and are overjoyed to  be able to use more than 64K of memory, its a major improvement. For Windows users its more like an upgrade with facilities most Unix users take for  granted. Most of  Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running  3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even  a real issue. My ideal operating system:  	Binary compatible across all plaforms. It should recognize 	binaries and configure on the fly, so I don't have to have 	bin/Mac bin/DOS bin/Dec bin/Sun bin/HP etc...  	Multi-CPU. So I can use the CPUs on my PC and W/S and Mac  	and Transputers and DSPs. I don't know a single site which  	has gone for a single vendor. I am not going to trade-in  	80Mflops per H1 transputer or ultra-fast FFT on DSP chips. 	Note NT runs on Symmetric multi-CPU systems.  	Built-in portable GUI/Graphics tools. You can call DrawButton  	or DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform  	or display. It should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly. 	so I can use PC graphics S/W on my workstation and X software on   	my PC. I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential.  	Configurable front-end. So you can make it look like Unix or DOS 	or NT or OS/2, and run shell scripts or command/BAT files.  	Object oriented. So I can program easily under it and not have 	to re-invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch 	or my application needs to access source/object code on the fly.  In other words it should have some AI capability. That and a tight, clean kernel so you can actually understand it.

You have shown that some aspects of MSW3.1 are technically inferior to other systems.  As I said earlier, if this is all you are trying to say then it is trivially true.

Quality of Documentation?  If you think that technical excellence is the only factor when deciding on an OS, or indeed the primary factor, you need to think again.

Brian K., I am pleased with your honesty.  And to be honest as well, I believe you have not asked my god to come to you.  Why do I say this? Because by the things you write on the net, and the manner with which you write them, you show me that you made up your own god and are attempting to pass him off as the real thing.  I got news for you. Yours doesn't at all sound like mine.  Your god doesn't come to you because your god doesn't exist.  >I've gone into this with an open mind.

Zeus seems like a pretty cool candidate...  I am sorry Brian, but when I read your postings, I do not see an open mind. What I do see is misunderstanding, lack of knowledge, arrogance and mockery.  >Please tell me what more I can do while still remaining true to myself.  Be true to yourself then.  Have an open mind.  And so end the mockery.  Gain  knowledge of the real God.  Put your presumptions aside.  Read the Bible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything and there exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond our shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself   to seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a person who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find  something to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one will gain with that attitude is folly.  Be careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages in the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even though they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not. Be assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such deep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied.  I will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, "You will never be thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over."   From King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):      "It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;      to search out a matter is the glory of kings."   Jesus says in John 6:44 & 55:     "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him."   And in John 3:16:     "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,    that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal    life."   You are included in "whosoever".  And I also pray that the Father is drawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn't be posting to talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in the making.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasure stoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul became on of the most celebrated men in the history of God's church.  You see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, because you could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attack Christians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul, proclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.  Or you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would  probably say to you: "Satan would surely like to have you."  Why so? Because Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated great moments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a task he did with full heart.  Peter was the only apostle to have the faith to walk on water as Jesus did.  You asked "Why not believe in Zeus?"  Zeus didn't offer eternal life. You got nothing to gain by believing in Zeus.  ------------------------------- Brian Ceccarelli brian@gamma1.lpl.arizona.edu

To paraphrase Sartre, the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point.  It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing.  Your logic comes to fruition in relativism.   > >"At the core of all well-founded belief, lies belief that is unfounded." >                                                    -- Ludwig Wittgenstein  Ah, now it is clear.  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig's fame is often explained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in contemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus ('21) and Philosophical Investigation ('53).  Many of Witt's comments and implicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of language he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt's thought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary framework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features remain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being transcended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving us a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt's own account, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that any critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to talking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but a threshold.   vonWrights's comment that Witt's "sentences have a content that often lies deep beneath the surface of language."  On the surface, Witt talks of the insuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing ourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with Witt's own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes in our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more perspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it is already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to offer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his Tractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse of the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man.  Perfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about our buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.    This is why John's Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in it conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of understanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of "as a man thinketh, so he is."  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside, that is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals of truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that there is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too are knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the individual.  There is, and we shouldn't shy from this, a mysticism to Christianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the one who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the Spirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has the capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not only has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things of God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep things of GOd that are absolute and true.    There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced and it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion because if it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.    "I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would say unto me."  Job 23ff  --Rex  suggested, easy reading about epistimology:  "He is there and He is not Silent"  by Francis Schaeffer.

INTENSIVE JAPANESE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH THIS SUMMER     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   The University of Pittsburgh is offering two intensive Japanese language courses this summer.  Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and  Intensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses  each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin  June 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours  per day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.   Fellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact  Steven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology Management Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or address below.   ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO  UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.        ####################################################################### #################   New Program Announcement   ######################## #######################################################################               JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM  The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon  University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific  communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and  January 1994.   PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the  United States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is  facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.   PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to  develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:  1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time.  2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in  manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a  variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology, Sociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums will be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or  research facilities in the United States will be scheduled.   3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU,  participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe, and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan will generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.   FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS STIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.

Bruce,     It seems like you are advocating social change based on your concept of human nature, and that concept seems pretty Utopian. It's obvious from even a cursory study of history that no system, regardless of the authority it may claim for its basis, will make people act any better. Until human nature changes, the products of our nature won't change, and that has to include society. I think your assessment of human potential in this regard is too optimistic.     What is needed is an absolute moral standard if -all- people are to create any Utopias. By implying a Utopian future, you also argue for an absolute standard that applies to everyone in every case. I realize that you may not acknowledge the connection, but it's there.  Bill

Many thanks for all replies, the majority of people  recommended PCXremote from NCD. I received it yesterday  and installed it on my Sparc and PC with only one hitch.  The UNIX install consists of copying 2 files into some local bin directory.  On the PC side, I ordered the WINDOWS version  which  came with a slick windows installation.   The only problem I had was that  my .xinitrc  in my home directory had the line DISPLAY=`hostname`:0.0; export DISPLAY  s.t the clients I kicked off connected to my Xserver on the Sparc console. By removing this line from the .xinitrc everything worked as planned and the clients connected to the server at  `hostname`:1.0  Some comments on performance, I was connected to a Sparc 2 thru a NetBlazer Terminal Server over a 9600 baud line. My PC is a 486-DX2 ATI Ultra, 16 MB  Bitmap Stuff Sucked. Basic Editing and compilation stuff definitely usable. Xmail was very usable.  At times the first time U typed in an Xclient window there was a very noticable delay, I put this down to brain damaged "WINDOWS should not be called a SCHEDULER", besides that this will become my remote work environment for a while.  Has anybody tried the NON Windows version of the product, the sales person said they performed about the same, given the over head of WINDOWS I question this?  many thanks for help to all who responded  gerard

It seems to me that you are the one who is supposed to do some reading. I think that our major difference in opinion is on the legitimacy of Sevres. First, thattreaty was signed by the Ottoman Empire therefore legally it does not bind the  Republic of Turkey. The new independence movement (which by the way, is not the same as the Young Turks) naturally rejected it out of hand. to say that we  should accept because the Germans did theirs is absurd. We saw what the cosequences of such harsh treaties were in Hitler. Second, the Sevres treaty was even  worse than Versailles. It divided the Ottoman Empire in to several influence  zones, had the capital occupied, the economy under Allied control, the army di minished to nothing but a police force, in short a country in name only. I'd wonder if you would like to live under such conditions. And for the record, I donot feel sorry for the soldiers killed in IZMIR harbour. Before evacuating the  city, the Greek forces burned it down, so it serves them right. As for being fooled by Allied promises, that too is your fault. You did not come to Anatolia just to enforce Sevres but to take part in the plunder  as well. K. Burak Ucer -

The question is how much that quality is worth to a ham in amateur service, not commercial service  >This radio can hear a repeater thats 40 miles away without > an antenna.  Ok, great. But how often does that come up?  How good is "good enough", and how much is someone willing to pay for it? A good ham-quality HT is maybe $500, while a commercial quality one is maybe $2000. Is the increased reliability and performance worth 4 times the price *in amateur service*? Only the individual involved can answer that question, and each ham has to decide for him/herself.  If Motorola quality is worth 4 times the price to you, then more power to ya'. But I'm amazed that folks make that choice. For, me, given that I've got $2000 to spend, I'l pick the Yaesu ht and a nice new HF rig every time over a Motorola ht alone, no matter how good it is.  To me, ham-quality gear is "good enough". To each his own...  73... Mike, N4PDY  ****************************** * These are my opinions only.* ******************************

In short:      The ticket was for not stopping at a stop sign. Given the conditions    I could not stop in time and decided instead of sliding right through the    intersection, I would complete my right-turn and avoid a possible accident.    A police cruiser happened to be approaching the intersection from my left    and gave me the ticket.      The officer said "The only reason that you even slowed down in the first    place was that you saw me approaching, otherwise you would have bombed right    through"     I would like to thank all those who responded favorably to my request for  help. To all of those who told me to bite the bullet and pay the fine:  PHGHGHGHGH..   The judge sided with me and decided that in this case "Not stopping" was the  safest thing to do and found me NOT GUILTY.    The officer's statement and my account of the conditions at the time (very   slippery, backed by newpaper weather conditions) were the factors what made   the judge decide on his verdict.     Moral: If you have never been to court before and you think you have a case, 	 go for it. It is a very interesting process, and it is there for 	 your benefit. Exercise your rights.

There was no elaboration as to where specfically the item was found, of what type of wrench it was, but the anchorperson did say something about a NASA official commenting that there would be an inquiry into how the thing got in the SSRB.  Has anybody else on the net whose info sources may be  better than mine heard anything about this?  It seems rather weird.  Mitch ---------------------------->jmcocker@eos.ncsu.edu

For instance, the goal of natural morality is the propogation of a species, perhaps.  It wasn't really until the more intelligent animals came along that some revisions to this were necessary.  Intelligent animals have different needs than the others, and hence a morality suited to them must be a bit more complicated than "the law of the jungle."  I don't think that self-actualization is so subjective as you might think.  And, by objectivity, I am assuming that the ideals of any such system could be carried out completely.  keith

The best reason for ATM is that Adobe IS the standard.  Truetype is a failed MS venture to undercut Adobe when Adobe was being nasty about keeping their formats proprietary.  Just about any service bureau or print shop will smirk and send you on your way if you bring a TrueType document to them for high resolution printing or ripping.  Although there are lots of pretty TT fonts floating around, they are really for dot matrix or your own lazer printer. However, you can convert your TT fonts with Fontmonger or some similar program to ATM fonts for high end stuff.  If you are using dot matrix for all your printing, you may have wasted your money!

I got my first one in college about 5 or so years ago.  	I've been a happy HP user of the DeskWriter for Macintosh for past 5 years. I got one just a few months after their release. And I got software revision 1.0a (now I'm up to rev. 3.1. Our family (sister and father) have each purchased their own DW's after seeing mine go for one year unscathed (their stuck to their trusty ImageWriter II's). The original DW has gone for 5 years at moderate personal use. I would say that it has gone through at least 15,000 sheets, and around one (small) ink cartridge every 3 months or so.  	My brother might take this DW now (I'm probably gonna give it to him), and I am looking to upgrade to a color DW. The chief advantages/disadvantages I've found over the years are:  Advantages:	Quick (2-3 ppm), Quiet (roomate can sleep while it's printing), AppleTalk Networkable (unfortunately the original wasn't, so look out if you buy used. I rewired our home with phonenet AppleTalk connectors, and while home, we can all use my dad's one DW!), and cheap (now run ~$300). BTW, you can upgrade older DW's to color or for appletalk, I dunno if HP still does the upgrades, but I received many offers (I just didn't ned it however). Also, crisp laser-quality output is a wonder (used to really impress those ImageWriter Dot-Matrix people so much so, that I had to charge $0.25 per sheet to stop my college dorm neighbors from bothering me at all hours of the night....)  Disadvantages.	Ink used to be hard to find, and wasn't cheap, and wasn't originally water-proof. While HP has done wonders with the ink (I dunno if it's still toxic), it is still subjet to smearing and running (if you run around in the damp Boston rain, and get your bookbag completely soaked). Ink now runs about $14-$15 for small carts (I get mine from Elek-Tek in Chicago, I think they're now down to $12). The ink carts used to say they're dated for only 6 months, but I don't think they say so anymore. We stick to a 4 month supply (of about 3 carts). We use cheap Hammerhill Laser Print paper (after fooling for a long time. Laser/Xerox paper is also good). Smearing doesn't happen, unless you have a brand new ink cart and you grab the paper and smudge it all over as soon as it comes out of the machine. Other disadvantages are : No Postscript (this can be an advantage in speed, usually). Ways around this are Ghostscript or Freedom of Press software solutions. I bet HP probably has a PS prototype inkjet, but they won't release it for fear of hurting LJ sales.  In the end, the primary advantages of laser are true postscript (unless you go for cheap lasers), and fused toner (no smearing, even when soaking in water). Lasers are slightly sharper, but the only instance where I needed precise layouts was Printed Circuit Board Transparencies for PhotoEtching. I found a Textronix color Phaser Postscript (Thermal Wax Transfer) to work the best to make PCB negatives directly onto a transparency.  Well, hope my babbling has helped. -squish@endor.harvard.edu

Well, when you say, without Morris, you have to mention an assumed replacement.  If the alternative to Morris was letting Cito Gaston soft-toss the ball underhand to the opposition every 5 days, then of course the Blue Jays wouldn't have won without Morris.  If the alternative was replacement level, then I think it would've been very close, and yes, Morris might've made the difference.  If the alternative was Frank Viola, the Blue Jays probably would have won more easily with Viola.  >Last year, when the team went 13-15 for the month of August, and all the  >other starters were being shelled, and Milwaukee was making a charge, >Morris went 5-1 with a pretty good era (I can't remember exactly).

But Morris, being a  >veteran pitcher, knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in >baseball.  By saving himself, he was able to reach back for that little extra >(I hate this too!) when the game was on the line.  Well, I think is complete bs.  What happened most of the time is that Morris fell behind, and the team came back and rescued him.  Mostly, this is because he's a lousy 1st inning pitcher, and much better the rest of the way.  That the team can climb out of 4-0, 5-0 holes consistently and win them 6-5 is not to Morris' credit; it's to the team's credit.  Furthermore, while Morris did exceed the W-L percentage that would be projected from his runs allowed and run support, he hasn't done this in previous years.  In fact, his W-L record in 1991 is a lot worse than what it projects to be with run support and runs allowed. Do you think he just came up with this ability in 1992.  Look at the 2 postseason games he pitched decently in.  Typical Morris games.  Morris gets behind; team rescues him.  He's not responsible for that rescue.  And in both those games, the team just didn't rescue him enough.  Jack Morris pitched as well as he did during much of the season in those 2 games; the offense just didn't earn him a victory.  >BTW, I think he should be put in the bullpen; it would be embarrassing a  >veteran pitcher which Cito would never do, but his era is 17+, how much more >can he be embarrassed?  Morris is one of those guys who will reture when he can't start anymore; he's too bad a first inning pitcher to serve in the bullpen.  Greg

Tis' only a gleam in my eye at this point.  I have yet to chose a tracking  method.  The initial requirement was to design a system to locate a dancer in one of eight zones across the stage.  I did some experiments with  pyroelectric detectors and found them difficult to align to get a definite zone transition.  And dancers stand still alot, so their IR signature goes away.  The good thing about pryoelectrics is that their signal is proportional  to the size of the warm body (or body part), and the velocity of said body. This could be useful for detecting the intensity of a dance gesture.  Dancers also really hate to wear little boxes and batteries strapped on their  bodies, but they really need to be emitting some kind of signal to be tracked.  The current toy I have been working with is a program called Mandala for the Amiga, used with a LIVE! video digitizer.  This works with a video camera  trained on the stage.  You can set thresholds for a zone within the field of view, and an object brighter than the threshold will trigger an event. Events can be MIDI objects or sequences, Amiga sounds or graphic objects.  It's been fun to play with, but the documentaion is arcane, and the digitizer is noisy. Still, it's very appealing, the dancers don't have to wear any appliances, you can have ots of zone,s, it speaks MIDI, which can be used to control lights, and I don't have to build any electronics.  It's all done with lighting and video brightness and contrast adjustments.  I have yet to do anything particularly useful or artistic, but I have hopes...

A 3-D widget is usually located in the same scene as other 3-D objects of the  application.  It may let you  - manipulate application data, the camera,   3-D objects in the scene and so on, or - view the status of the application or 3-D objects   via the widget's shape, color, position, orientation and so on, or - do whatever I missed but you think is possible.  For example, a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball (shown as a partially transparent sphere) super-imposed on the object to be rotated. A feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to 2 objects.  The length of the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on the ruler indicating the distance.  A widget can provide both manipulation and feedback.  For example, the ruler can be used to change the distance between the objects along its own axis.   Please e-mail me or post your opinions on 3-D interaction.  The information I gathered will help me design a 3-D UI construction tool. Your help is very much appreciated.

Chevy proved it many years ago with the '70 Camaro (ETs and terminal 1/4 mile times were close enough tpo be identical for 4 speed and auto cars).

It was a very quiet and meaningful time of prayer.  |-------------------| | Gary Chin         | | Staff Engineer    | | Sun Microsystems  | | Mt.

BTW, I believe he picked up an alcohol problem after (before?) the incident.  To radically change the subject, the Caps must be having nightmares about the Isles in overtime in the playoffs.  Have they *ever* beaten the Islanders in a playoff OT game?  This is lunacy.  The Caps are such a sorry team in the playoffs, they consistently choke against opponents who they should be beating.

In the list you mentioned, tgif handles everything except rotation and any size text.  It only supports 90 degrees rotation.  Currently, it supports 11 (X11R4 standard) font sizes.  However, it allows arbitrary scaling of the entire drawing.  Effectively, it allows any font sizes, but you can only have 11 different sizes per drawing.  Tgif takes up 850K (compiled with -O option) on a SPARCstation.  I was told that it compiles under Linux, but I haven't tried it yet.

I have an Ultrix machine running both TCP/IP and DECnet. I have a number of X-terminals hanging off the Ultrix host also running TCP/IP and DECnet. Presently I am using XDM for the login procedure on the X-terminals using TCP/IP. Since XDM is basically just an X-windows client, shouldn't I be able to run XDM on the DECnet protocol tower as well?  My first inclination is that XDM is not your typical X client. It is making TCP/IP specific socket calls. In this case the answer would be no; you can not run XDM over DECnet. Is this right or not? Any feedback is appreciated. Thanks.

It is posted roughly every month or so by different persons, and that doesn't make it any better.  How did you get the idea that skeptics are closed-minded?  Why don't you consider the possibility that they came to their conclusions by the proper methods?  Besides, one can come to a conclusion without closing one's mind to other possibilities.  I you don't agree with a person, please ask him why he thinks like that, instead of insulting him.  Perhaps he's right.  Follow your own advice, be open-minded.  If you don't post a bit of evidence for your claims, I'll complain that it's always those "neither a real believer, nor a disbeliever" types who  narrow-mindedly judge others without knowing their motives.  -- thomas kettenring, 3 dan, kaiserslautern, germany The extraterrestrials don't even know this planet has native inhabitants.

I can see the relationship between free throws awarded after a certain number of fouls, but it's obviously easier to score in basketball, there are more opportunities.  If a basketball team scores 100 points, that's at least fifty chances made.  The average number of shots taken by each team in a hockey game (and this is a total guess) is probably around 40, and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe 5 of them.  You have some good ideas concerning the other penalties, but I think that a player should be awarded a penalty shot only when they had a chance to score and was interfered with.  Also, later in the post, you talked about how boring the NBA game you attended was, that play was stopped too often. Wouldn't your penalty shot rule take up more time during a hockey game?

Advantages stated of circumcison included probably prevention of penile cancer, (which, interestingly, occurs mostly in men whose personal hygiene is exceptionally poor), simplicity of personal hygiene, prevention of urinary tract infections, and prevention of a unretractible foreskin,  Disadvantages include infection from the  procedure, pain, etc.  I apologize; I am trying to pull this off the top of my head.  I will post what I discovered in research; I did a paper on the topic in my research class in Nursing school. It really is a decision that is up to the parents.  Some parents use the reasoning that they will "look like Daddy" and like their friends as justification.  There is nothing wrong with this; just be sure it is what you want to do, since it is rather difficult to uncircumcise a male, although a major surgical procedure exists.  >How about the pregnant woman sitting in a tub of water?  We've heard  >stories of infection, etc.  How about after the water has broken? >  As long as your membranes have not broken and you have not had any problems with your pregnancy, it should be OK to sit in a tub of water. HOWEVER, I WOULD RECOMMEND USING YOUR OWN BATHTUB IN YOUR OWN HOME! It is nearly impossible to guarantee the cleanliness and safety of "public" hot tubs.  A nice warm bath can be very relaxing, especially if your back is killing you!  And it would possibly be advisable to avoid bubble bath soap , esp. if you are prone to yeast infection.  Hope these tips help you some.  Elisa picl25@fsphy1.physics.fsu.edu

Fact is, the FBI doesn't want to listen to your phone calls, and if they do, and if you're using triple-DES, they'll just get a parabolic microphone and point it at your head.  	This is pretty clearly an effort by the government to do exactly what they're saying they're doing. As is typical with governments, it's mismanaged, and full of holes and compromises. As is typical with our government, it's not too bad, could be worse.  	My interpretation.

I don't think it's the awkward  recursive deletion that's bugging people, it certainly isn't the nice Windows  interfaces for new DOS accessories (CPAV, defrager, undelete).  	As far as I've noticed, it's DoubleSpace crashes.  Frankly, the fairly high rates of DoubleSpace crashes I've heard of surprises  me!  I figured that since the OS is presumably aware of DoubleSpace, it is  less likely to crash (unlike Stacker, which fools the OS... but DO is gullible  anyway :).  DOS 6 _is_ aware of DoubleSpace isn't it?  Anyway, good job on DOS 5, and DOS 6 is good for new users.  Just beware the  doublespace!

Any machine powered by heat (motor, steam- or gasturbine, steamengine,   thermoelement,etc) work the better, the bigger the temperature difference   between input and output is. Because You never get all thermic energy out of   the powering medium (steam, burning gaz, etc), You have to eliminate the rest   of the energy to keep the efficency high. A thermal electric power plant (coal,   oil or atomic power) works just the same way. You heat water (steam) to power   the turbine and generators. Because You don't get the whole energy out of the   steam (efficency is never 100%) You have to cool down this steam again by   something else. Most power plants use cooling towers for this purpose (some   type of mega-refrigerator...). Others use water of a river (ecologically not   unobjectionable). Got it ?

In response to Email requests, I have assembled this list of large-integer arithmetic packages of which I have heard. Most of these are C function libraries, available in source form.  For your convenience, I have placed copies of some of these on ripem.msu.edu (35.8.1.178).  They are available for anonymous FTP in the directory "pub/bignum". However, what I have may not be the most current version in all cases.  Here they are, in no particular order:  mp     Multiple Precision package that comes with some Unixes          Multiple precision package accessed via -lmp flag on your     compiler.  Provides +, -, *, /, gcd, exponentiation,     sqrt.  Comes with SunOS, NeXT Mach, BBN Mach 1000,      and probably a few others.  See "man mp".       Object code only, of course.  PARI     Henri Cohen, et al., Universite Bordeaux I, Paris, FRANCE          Multiple precision desk calculator and library routines.     Contains optimized assembly code for Motorola 68020,      semi-optimized code for SPARC, and apparently rather slow     generic C version.  Does both integers and reals.     Does vectors and matrices as well as scalars.     Contains a number of advanced functions, some of which I've     never heard of.  ("Weber's function"?)     Has a factorization function, primality test, & other related stuff.     Plenty of TEX documentation.     Public domain, but you can't distribute modified versions.     Available via anonymous FTP from math.ucla.edu.  There seem to     be Mac- and NeXT-specific versions there in addition to:     Filename:  pari-1.35a.tar.Z      Arithmetic in Global Fields  (Arith)     Kevin R. Coombes, David R. Grant          Package of routines for arbitrary precision integers or     polynomials over finite fields.  Includes basic +, -, *, /     and a few others like gcd.  Source code in C.     Distributed under the terms of the GNU public license.     Includes man pages and TEX documentation.     Filename:  arith.tar.Z  Arbitrary Precision Math Library     Lloyd Zusman   Los Gatos, CA          C package which supports basic +, -, *, /.  Provides for radix     points (i.e., non-integers).  Not as polished as the others here.     Posted to comp.sources.misc in October 1988.     Filename:  apml.tar.Z      BigNum     J. Vuillemin, INRIA, FRANCE, and others.     Distributed by Digital Equipment Paris Research Lab (DECPRL)          A "portable and efficient arbitrary-precision integer" package.     C code, with generic C "kernel", plus assembly "kernels" for     MC680x0, Intel i960, MIPS, NS32032, Pyramid, and of course VAX.     This is probably one of the better-known packages of this type.     Implements +, -, *, /, mod, plus logical operations OR, AND, XOR.     Both signed and unsigned arithmetic available.     Available via email from librarian@decprl.dec.com.     You will receive 5 shell archives.  Give your postal address     and you will also receive printed documentation from France.     Package includes TEX documentation.     Publicly available for non-commercial use.     I removed this from my archive when I heard a rumor that PRL     doesn't like others to distribute it.  However, BIGNUM *is*     distributed as part of ecpp (see below).  Lenstra's package     Arjen Lenstra   Bellcore          Portable unsigned integer package written entirely in C.     Includes +, -, *, /, exponentiation, mod, primality testing,     sqrt, random number generator, and a few others.  The package     was uncommented and undocumented; I have tried to add enough     comments to get by.  This is the only of these packages that I     have actually used.  It works well and is very portable.       I haven't done any benchmarks against the others, but the code      looks clever & Lenstra is an accomplished number theorist.     Unlike the other packages here, this one requires you to allocate     storage statically--only a problem if your numbers are really huge.     Arjen has placed the code in the public domain.       Filename:  lenstra.tar.Z  lenstra_3.1     Arjen Lenstra,  Bellcore      An improved version of Arjen's package above.  This one     does signed arithmetic and dynamic allocation (which can be turned     off as an option). Has a few new routines, too.  "lenstra_3.1" contains     minor bugfixes to the previously-available "lenstra_2" and "lenstra_3".     Filename:  lenstra_3.1.c  bmp  (Brent's Multiple Precision?)     R. P. Brent      1981 vintage FORTRAN code to do extended precision floating &     fixed point arithmetic.  Includes most of the mathematical     functions you'd find in a FORTRAN run-time library.     This code is an ACM algorithm, number 524.     To obtain, send a mail message to  netlib@ornl.gov     containing the line "send mp.f from bmp" or better yet, perhaps     just start with "help".  SPX     Kannan Alagappan & Joseph Tardo, DEC          This is a huge prototype public key authentication system     based on RSA.  I mention it here because those who have heard     of SPX have probably correctly guessed that it contains a large     integer package and I want to inform you that the large integer     package it contains is indeed DEC's BigNum from France.     You can get a beta test copy of SPX from crl.dec.com (192.58.206.2).      Use it only for testing, as it "may" expire on a certain date.     (I don't know whether this has expired yet.)  amp  (Antti's Multiple Precision?)     Antti Louko   alo@kampi.hut.fi      Multiple precision integer package in C.  Includes +, -, *, /, %,     pow, mod, 1/x mod y, random, sqrt, gcd.  Available for non-commercial     use.  The package includes "share-secret", a public key system based     on the Diffie-Hellman algorithm.     This is normally part of the well-known "des-dist.tar.Z",     but I have removed the DES part to avoid having to deal with      cryptographic export laws, and have named the result:     Filename:  amp.tar.Z  gennum       Per Bothner   U of Wisconsin-Madison      C++ routines and classes to do generic arithmetic, both     integer and rational.

MIRACL     (By someone in Dublin, Ireland)      Integer and fractional multiple precision package.     Includes factorization, primality testing, encryption.     Not public domain, apparently.

Will in the future     conform to the Common Lisp functions that handles integers.     Currently includes +, -, *, /, exponentiation, "exptmod",     comparison, random numbers, and gcd.     Filename: bignum-1.2  GNU Multiple Precision     GNU (Free Software Foundation) multiple precision package.     I haven't looked at it yet.  This is current as of April 1992,     but there may be a more recent version by the time you read      this.  This package is very widely available on FTP sites.     Filename: gmp-1.2.tar.Z  Elliptic Curve Primality Proving      Francois Morian, France.      Large package to prove the primality of any prime.     Includes Inria's BIGNUM package.

Filename: ecpp.V3.4.1.tar.Z  PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)     Philip Zimmermann   prz@sage.cgd.ucar.EDU      Intel-based crypto package that includes bignum routines in C,     said to be quite fast for Intel processors.  Unix and Mac     versions also available.     The crypto package violates RSA patents, but the bignum routines     can be used without fear of legal repercussions.  Bell's Arbitrary Precision Calculator     David I. Bell, Australia  (dbell@pdact.pd.necisa.oz.au)      Arbitrary-precision calculator with good online help, C-like     language, many builtin functions, support for integers,     rational numbers (they work like floating point), complex numbers,     matrices, strings, lists, files, "objects".  Includes      gcd, primality testing, even trig functions.  Recommended.     (Large package, though.)  Obtained from comp.sources.unix.     Filename: calc-1.24.7.tar.Z  Built-in support in other languages     Various      Multiple precision arithmetic is available in a number of      programming languages, such as Lisp and ABC (cf. mcsun.eu.net).     Perl (by Larry Wall, available from devvax.jpl.nasa.gov)     includes source, in Perl, for such a package, but it's probably     not suitable for serious use.     For some of these, source code may be available.  This list is     long enough, so I'm not going to pursue it aggressively.  Thanks to Ed Vielmetti and several others who contributed to this list.

I haven't read enough of either to comment, although >everyone tells me I should read Nietzche.  I would have to say that the "greatest philosopher" title would have to go to Plato since the whole enterprise of philosophy was essentially defined by him.  Although he got most of his answers wrong, he did  definitively identify what the important questions are.  I think it was Descartes who said that "All philosophy is just a footnote to Plato."  If I were to choose which philosopher made the most important advances in human knowledge over his lifetime, that's simple...it is Aristotle. This is so much the case that many simply refer to him as "the philosopher".  Regarding Nietzsche, he's one of the most entertaining, although since his ideas were so fragmented (and since his life was cut short) it is doubtful that his influence as a philosopher is likely to be very extensive 500 years from now.  They'll probably still be reading him in 500 years though.  As for "modern" philosophers, I would have to say that Kant was the most influential since he had such a strong influence on almost everyone who came after him (and unfortunately, they maintained his errors and  amplified them over time).  I would say that the most influential "american" philosopher would have to be Dewey.  But as to the question of what philosopher will be most highly regarded in 500 years, it may very well be Ayn Rand (who in every important respect was "American", but was born in Russia).  But I guess that remains to be seen.  --Brian

I don't buy it.  If the things had no value at all, people wouldn't spend money to make them. So their lack of value is just your opinion, not an actual fact, which is neither a philisophical or legal basis for prohibiting them.  On the other hand, I lived in OakBrook IL for a while, where zoning laws prohibit billboards, as you mention above.  I think it was a fine law, despite it's contradictory basis.  I would guess that the best legal and moral basis for protest would be violation of private property.  "I bought this house, out in the boondocks, specifically to enjoy my hobby, amateur astronomy.  Now this billboard has made that investment worthless, so I want the price of the property, in damages."  It wouldn't take too many succesful cases like that to make bill-sats prohibitively expensive.  -Tommy Mac ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tom McWilliams 517-355-2178 wk   \ They communicated with the communists, 18084tm@ibm.cl.msu.edu 336-9591 hm \ and pacified the pacifists. -TimBuk3 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

I tend to agree.  I came here when it first started and watched it grow from the roots on talk.religion.misc.  It seemed to take a while for enough atheists to come forward to get past the "Let's trash Xians" and such. Now there's a stable core, and frankly there's a feeling that this is _our_ group.  If we go mainstream, we're going to be in a lot more places.  And every fucking fundy loonie freshman will be dumping on us to find Jeesus! and warn us that we're all going to Hell.  Want to see what we'll get?  Go real alt.fan.brother-jed and imagine that those imbecilic tirades will be here.  All the time.  Every other post.  I'm being selfish.  I find I really learn a lot here and the S/N isn't too bad.  The Browns and the Boobys are a distraction, but they are few enough that they even bring in some of the leavening needed to offset them.  But I greatly fear that mainstreaming would basically put us at the swamping level of the Conners of the world.

Ideally I would like a hdftoppm type of utility, from which I can then use the PBMplus stuff quite merrily. I can convert the cropped part into another format for viewing/animation.  Otherwise, can someone please explain how to set up the NCSA Visualisation S/W for HDF (3.2.r5 or 3.3beta) and do the above cropping/etc. This is for Suns with SunOS 4.1.2.

The Stars goals were scored by Mike McPhee and Ulf Dahlen, who netted two including the final one in franchise history, with less than a minute to play.  Tonight, on the air on the Stars TV telecast, announcer Al Shaver, the voice of the North Stars, stated basically that he will not follow the team to  Dallas.

I cannot deny that actions of fanatics from both sides were reported. A minority of Greek idiots indeed attack religious places, which were protected by the Greek police.

Oh NO. PLEASE DO GIVE AS A BRAKE ! Minorities in Turkish treated like that ?

Sometimes two elco's in antiseries (you know, positive sides facing eachother) are used to obtain a large capacitor that can handle positive and negative voltages as well.  So there probably is no design-philosophical reason, but a production-cost one.  Best 73's  Wouter

The algorithm is classified.   I speculate, from the MykoTronx data sheet on the MYK-78, that the algorithm  is a classified cryptosystem, similar in application to DES but cleared by  the NSA for classified traffic, that has been in use for a number of years.   Myktotronx refers to it as "Government Type II encryption", which matches the  designation of one of the types of encryption available on STU-III phones,  and may be the same as a cryptosystem I have heard called "CIPHER2".  This would make sense, since this is evidently a field-proven cryptosystem  which can act as a "pin-compatible" substitute for DES.  Combined with a  tappable key exchange protocol, this would offer exactly what is claimed for  Clipper: secure encryption with access via a key escrow.  If this is fact the  case, it would make me quite confident of the encipherment algorithm itself.  Now, I do not know if these are in fact the same cryptosystem; my knowledge  of classified cryptography isn't even fuzzy :), it's nonexistent.  However,  it would certainly have been the least-effort approach on the part of the  government: take an old military cipher that people can drop in place of DES  (and which is at least as secure), set up a key escrow scheme for law  enforcement, and promote it for public use.  This also fits with Mykotronx,  who's been around but almost invisible for years.  Has anyone else made this sort of connection, or am I just hallucinating pink  elephants here? :).  My curiousity has been piqued...   Amanda Walker InterCon Systems Corporation

I've put together a list and indicated what I think each item is worth.  This is just my estimate, and I am very open to any offers, including trades.  I'm currently looking for some CD-ROMs that will work with a Mac CD ROM player CD Caddies, HD floppy  disks, any used Macintosh software, a 387-33Mhz Co-Processor, or basically  anything you have lying around (cans of soup, the neighbor's cat, etc...)   Make me an offer, no offer will be overlooked...  I really want to get rid of this stuff...  Ok, Here's the list:  52 Meg 3.5" SCSI Hard Drive.  Conner Model #CP-3150.  I bought this from a guy 	at a swap meet to use with my Macintosh.  Unfortunately, I can't seem  	to get it to work with the SCSI controller in my computer.  The 	guy tested it with his PC, and printed out a copy of the Norton Disk  	Doctor report which says it has no bad sectors. (I'll send you a copy)  	I was dumb enough not to get his phone number, so I can't return it to  	him. The drive has many jumpers on it, (which I don't know how to set)  	so maybe that's the problem.  I was quite disappointed that it didn't 	work so I'm trying to minimize my losses.	~$45  52 Meg 3.5" SCSI Hard Drive. Conner Model #CP-3150.  Same situation as above. 	I bought both of these drives from the same guy.  Despite the different 	model numbers they are the same exact drive.  Same report from NDD 	(I have one for each drive) will be included.	~$45  40 Meg SONY 3.5" SCSI Hard Drive.  SONY Model #SRD2040A.  The drive mechanism  	is completely trashed.  This hard drive was in my computer (Mac SE) and 	had a stiction problem.  Well, repeated banging on the side of the 	computer resulted in a head crash (yes, metal scraping metal) which 	was not too pleasant to listen to.  Still the SCSI controller 	card is in good working order, and can be used for parts, or a  	project.	~$20  65 Meg Seagate 5.25" HH SCSI Hard Drive.  Model #ST-277N.  I originally bought 	this drive, because it had a small stiction problem, and I though that 	I could fix it.  Well I determined that the drive mechanism was fine, 	and that it was a controller problem.  (motor controller wasn't sending 	proper signals.)  Well, after taking the controller off the drive,  	looking at it, and putting it back together, I realized that I 	accidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the  	drive to the controller.  I tried to solder it, but I'm not that good 	at soldering so I couldn't do it.  Worked perfectly before I messed 	up.  I used it as a temporary drive when the SONY (above) crashed on 	me.  Also loaded the drive with about twenty Mac applications, 	worth well over $1000.  (Claris CAD, MS Word 5.0, Think C, 	Excel, and many others)  	I think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable.  You also get all 	the software on the drive. (if you can accept being a pirate)  I only  	ask that you delete my data files from the drive.  I was really angry 	when I broke that connection, and then couldn't fix it.  I just don't  	have time to play with it any more.	~$65  AT&T ISDN 7500 Modem.  This is for use on digital phone systems.  If you know 	what this is or would like technical information on it, let me know.  I 	have some tech documents on it.  Is supposed to be the same thing as an 	AT&T digital phone, but without the phone part.  It seems to be in   	working order (passes self test perfectly OK).  I have no idea how  	this is worth...   Let me know if you're interested.  Motorola 68881 CoProcessor.  I haven't tested this one out yet, but if anyone  	is interested I will get it tested out, to make sure that it works.  I 	had trouble using it with my accelerator board, but then I spoke to the 	manufacturer of the board and found out it couldn't be used without  	another controller chip.  When I was looking around to buy one new, the 	prices were around $100.  I will guarantee this to work.	~$65  CGA Card.  Half-Length. 8-bit.  Wasn't working last time I checked (although 	I think I was using a bad monitor)	~$5  5.25"	360K Floppy Drive.  IBM Drive Type 1355.  Guaranteed to work,  	because when I took it out of the PC, it was working!		~$25  5.25" 360K Floppy Drive.  Toshiba Model Number ND-08DE-A.  Guaranteed to  	work.  Came out of same PC as above.	~$25  5.25"	Floppy Drives.  Can't guarantee that these will work.  I don't 	even know if they are low or high density drives.  I don't have 	any method of testing them. 		Panasonic Model number: JU-455-5 ACG.  There's another 			number on it: 2626-361723. 		Panasonic Model number: JU-475-2 AGG.  There's also 			another number on it: H3649-101457 		Toshiba Model Number ND-08DE.  Virtually identical to the one  			above. 	Each Drive ~$10  3.5" PS/2 Drive.  These things are proprietary, so I can't test it, but I 	think it works.  Not sure if it's high density or low density, but I 	suppose someone who is looking for one would know.  Model Number 	DFL413C04A.  I think these things are expensive to replace.  ~$35  MFM Hard Drive Controller Cards.  I've got three of these, and I have no way 	of testing them.  Two of them are 8-bit cards, and one is a sixteen bit 	card with a floppy controller built in.	~$10 for the 8-bits ~$15 for 	the 16-bit card w/floppy.  Interesting cable.  Seems to convert from a VGA plug to an EGA plug.  That is, 	standard nine-pin to VGA 15 pin. Made by Hewlett Packard.  Part No. 	D1181-80020		~$10    I've sold stuff like this before, and it was a huge success, with many  satisfied people trading or bartering stuff they didn't need anymore.  I  usually ship through the U.S. Postal Service (haven't had any problems yet)  and the shipping costs will be split or negotiated.  Well, that's all folks.  As I said before, no offer will be refused.  If you  can convince me to give OCit to you instead of throwing it out, TRY!  I hate to throw away stuff...   -Wayne  wdempsey@athena.mit.edu (617)-225-9349

Referring to the rest mass, or what I would just call mass, as m0...  The "new definition" is decades old! Anyone who has worked with SR since then would be familiar with it. If "most people" are familiar with m = gamma m0 (a highly questionable assertion anyway), I would expect it is on the large part due to learning SR from lousy popularizations instead of proper textbooks!  > In particular, as the FAQ points out, with mass redefined as a fundamental and > invariant property, E is no longer mc^2.

For example, people might think that the formula for kinetic energy still works if m = gaamma m0, ie. K.E. != 1/2 gamma m0 v^2.  Wrong. (In fact it's (gamma - 1)m0 c^2.) However, if you say p = gamma m v you always get the right answers.  In the end it does boil down to a matter of definition. You and I both know what is going on, and *that* is invariant! To say that things actually get heavier when moving fast (relative to the observer) misrepresents what is actually going on: it is better to say that momentum / velocity is observed to increase according to an external observer.  But people who haven't studied SR properly will still make mistakes or miss the point regardless of what you call mass.  > > You need a gravitational field to curve space, not speed (relative to > > what?). >  > I didn't say it was the speed that was curving space.

Yet, Write does >display the font correctly on the screen.  This is a common problem with highly complex TrueType fonts.  Microsoft admits to a problem with older versions of the PostScript printer driver, but I've found it to be pretty generic.  You can get around the problem by adjusting the parameter OutlineThreshold in the [TrueType] section of WIN.INI.  This entry specifies the number of pels-per-em at which Windows will render TrueType fonts as outline fonts instead of as bitmap fonts.  The default is 256.  I've generally been able to get fonts to work by setting OutlineThreshold=160.  Depending on your printer resolution and the point size you are using, you may need a different value.  The Windows Resource Kit warns against going above 300.  Presumably, that might cause fonts to print as square boxes or something.  :-|  (I'm not smiling.)  -- Bob Nichols AT&T Bell Laboratories rnichols@ihlpm.ih.att.com

Look for edge inconsistencies.  Consider two vertices, p and q, which are connected by at least one edge.  If (p,q) is an edge, then (q,p) should *not* appear.    If *both* (p,q) and (q,p) appear as edges, then the surface "flips" when you travel across that edge.  This is bad.    Assuming (warning...warning...warning) that you have an otherwise acceptable surface - you can pick an edge, any edge, and traverse the surface enforcing consistency with that edge.        0) pick an edge (p,q), and mark it as "OK"     1) for each face, F, containing this edge (if more than 2, oops)        make sure that all edges in F are consistent (i.e., the Face        should be [(p,q),(q,r),(r,s),(s,t),(t,p)]).  Flip those which        are wrong. Mark all of the edges in F as "OK",        and add them to a queue (check for duplicates, and especially        inconsistencies - don't let the queue have both (p,q) and (q,p)).      2) remove an edge from the queue, and go to 1).  If a *marked* edge is discovered to be inconsistent, then you lose.  If step 1) finds more than one face sharing a particular edge, then you lose.       Otherwise, when done, all of the edges will be consistent.  Which means that all of the surface normals will either point IN or OUT.

The reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder mask that is used. Older boards (bakelite and phenolic) rarely used a solder mask (these boards are not suited well to automatic stuffing and soldering techniques) and hence are the colour of the compound used to make them. These days boards are made of fibreglass for most general purpose uses and have a solder mask applied to them to prevent close traces shorting to one another during soldering (and also to prevent the decomposition of traces under harsh environments). The light and dark green boards ofter seen have a "dry film" mask applied to them (usually applied as a complete film photographically produced). The blue (and red or orange) boards are a two-part epoxy or a liquid-imageable resist formulation and are applied in a different manner.

Well, apparently we have another son of Dro 'the Butcher' to contend with.  You should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on distortions propagated by several of your contemporaries. If you feel  that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum  you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed. This is not a lecture to  another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist, but a fact.  I will dissect article-by-article, paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line,  lie-by-lie, revision-by-revision, written by those on this net, who plan  to 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is  nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide. We are neither in  x-Soviet Union, nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship,  that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest. Also, feel  free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists, the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armenian criminal organizations.  Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. You, and  those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up.  Not a chance.  Serdar Argic                             'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                              might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                              and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

If the mucus in one's nose collects (filters) particles going into the airway, if a child then picks and ingests this material, might it have a vaccinatory effect, since if the body ingests airborne diseases or other 'stuff' on the mucus, the body might generate antibodies for this small "invasion"?

The shock sensor is very sensitive, but much more practical than the motion sensor I have on my other car.  It doesn't trigger if the car is rocked gently by the wind, but any kind of shock sets it off.  Even kicking the tire sets it off.  It works great.  >  > What worries me is the hood and hatch.

You can adjust it to be sensitive enough that there is no way you could open the hood without setting off the alarm.  Although, I know that you cannot pop the hood on the Syclone without setting off my alarm now, and yet I have had zero (none!) false alarms with this system.  The alarm tells you when you disarm it whether it has been activated in your absence.  I have been able to trace every alarm to it's cause and it was not a false alarm. >  > I'm also wondering how easy it would be for a thief to crawl > underneath the car and cut the battery cable to disable the alarm. >  I guess it would be possible depending on the vehicle.  My Syclone is so tight in the engine compartment that it would be tough to do this.  There are supplemental power supplies you can put on with this Viper alarm, but I don't have one.  I really think that if someone wants my car that bad, the alarm won't keep them from it, even with a supplemental power supply.  > Viper also sells some fancy field disturbance sensor that > supposedly detects people approcahing the car.... >  This is primarily for convertibles.  I have a convertible and have looked at this feature in detail.  Alpine actually makes a better radar unit if you want to get one of these.  It has zones in it that can be shut down independently so that if one side of your car has pedestrian traffic or something else that would trigger an alarm, it shuts down the zone, or rather, pulls it in tighter. I don't see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that you leave the top down on.  Avoid the voice alarm that can be added to the radar package.  It talks to people as they walk by.  I saw one installed on a Lotus Esprit.  The kids would taunt it seeing how close they could get before it 'warned' them to get back.  The owner finally disabled it, which defeats the purpose in my mind. >  > I'm interested in the opinions of you netters about these problems > and about the viper in general. >  I am real happy with my Viper.  One other feature I really like is you can tune it to your preferences.  You can have it arm passively or not.  You can disable the chirp for arming/disarming.  You can have it lock/unlock the doors when the alarm is armed/disarmed.    I like these features.  I hate the chirp when the alarm arms/disarms, so mine flashes the lights only.  I like the door lock feature, although I have to be careful to take my keys with me because it doesn't know if you have left your keys in the car when it passively arms and locks the doors.  But, if you are meticulous about taking your keys with you, it takes care of the rest. > The car is an 89 Ford Probe GT that used to be in great shape! >  >  > Ron Garnett >   I looked seriously at the Alpine system too.  It is a real nice system, but more money and it has a motion sensor standard instead of the shock sensor.  The shock sensor is better....and the Viper shock sensor is better (2 cycle) than the optional Alpine one, IMHO.  I think the Viper gives you a lot of good value for the money.  But it isn't absolutely tamperproof.  No system is.  Except maybe the one that James Bond had on his Lotus in For Your Eyes Only.  Anyone know where we can get one of those installed?  Maybe that was what they had in the van in the World Trade Center, huh?>   Merrill

Traditionally, they have used pictures, words, demonstrations,     music and dance to communicate imagery.  However, expressing     complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well     defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far     exceed their technical skills.      The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression     tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and     virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the     observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of     simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar     representions, a confounded user asks: "What does it all mean?"      Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and     ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by     physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media     radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic     communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for     composing imagery for understanding.      Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a     breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the     physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,     psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and     discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the     computer graphics context.

Everything we need to know about the seven seals is already in the bible.  There is no "knowledge" of the seals that Koresh could have.  Unless the FBI were to kill all publishers of the bible, it would seem the story of the seven seals would be bound to leak out.  Assuming for the moment that the FBI believed in the bible and  were afraid of the seven seals, then they would also know that God is the one who has to open the seals, not some little prophet like Koresh.

Please forward your nominations to me: shell@cs.sfu.ca   The rules are that the person must be a Canadian citizen. They don't have to be born in Canada or even live in Canada, but they must have (or have had, if they are dead) Canadian citizenship while they are/were great Canadian scientists.   About 70 people have been nominated already and they are listed at the end of this posting.   I'm not quite sure what should constitute greatness, and there may be a gray area here. If you have any ideas on criteria for greatness, I would be pleased to hear them. In any event, please nominate people even if you are not sure they are great. I would like as big a list as possible.   Please give me a name and email address, phone number or mail address, so that I can contact the person. If you don't know any of the above, then give me their last known whereabouts. Also please give your reason for why you think the person should be considered a great Canadian scientist.   After I have the list, I will choose about six of the most interesting ones and do in-depth biographies of those individuals in the style of Tracy Kidder's "Soul of a New Machine" or some other dramatic technique. The rest of the great Canadian scientists will appear in an appedix with  one paragraph biographies.   If you have any other ideas about this project, I am interested to hear them.   So far, I have received 68 nominations as follows:     First Name     Last Name      Nominator            Famous For ----------     ---------      ---------            ---------- Sid            Altman         Kuszewski, John      Catalytic RNA(Nobel Chem 89) Frederick      Banting        me                   Insulin (Nobel U23 medicine) Davidson       Black          Stanley, Robert      Discovered Peking Man James R.

It's amazing to see just how much was discovered by Canadians. Actually there are many more who were born in Canada, but became Americans after graduate school.   Please note: a lot of people have nominated Alexander Graham Bell but I feel he was really a Scottish/American with a summer home in Canada. Now I know this is debatable, but please don't nominate him again.   If anyone can fill in some of the question marks on the list, please drop me a line. ==================================================   That was two years ago. Since then, I have received a grant from Science Culture Canada, a division of Supply and Services Canada to research the book. Since my old posting the book has evolved into an educational book for kids aged 9 - 14 (though this may change again) It will have about 40 two-page spreads with a large graphic in the middle and text/graphic boxes all around on the following subjects: Vital statistics and photo of the scientist, Personal statement from the scientist, Narrative of a few moments in the life of the scientist, "What I was doing when I was 12", So you want to be a <insert kind of scientist>, Experiment you can do. There  will be an appendix with 100 - 200 more scientists with one paragraph biographies who didn't quite make it to the double spreads. The whole thing will then be published on CD-ROM with video and sound clips for added richness. I am looking for a CD-ROM publisher as well. The text part may also be available on the CANARIE electronic highway being developed in Canada as well.   I am still looking for a publisher though Penguin Canada came close  to being it. Hope to find one soon.    I would like to again ask for more nominations, especially in the pure sciences of Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Also criticisms of  the list are welcomed. Also women and French-Canadian scientists are needed.   I hope this posting will get others to nominate more Great Canadian Scientists, and to discuss what is "great" what is "Canadian" and what is "scientist".

It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in, therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column that can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft, or 75 Statute miles.  Now, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss type, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength. Let us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical  strength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant section column.    A constant section column is not the limit on how high you can build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section as you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound load to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in calculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross sectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure below the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile  below the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.  The next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section to support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way to the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical limit on area, although there will be practical limits based on how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how much load you need to support on the ground (for which you need a foundation that the bedrock can support.  Let us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction cost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites, assuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure is just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass ratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower height becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant atmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still have to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses will be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity, but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus they represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting from the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.  This analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind loads.

According to this morning's Post-Gazette:  The Pens will be carried by KDKA-Radio(1020 am), unless the Pirates are playing.  When the Pirates play, the games will be carried by  WDVE(102.5 fm).  WDVE will carry 12 games, starting with tonight's game.  In fact, after this season, KDKA will no longer be the flagship station for the Pens.  The Penguins and KBL have struck a new  deal regarding the TV and radio rights to the games.  It seems more than likely that WDVE will be the flagship radio station next  season.  KBL will carry 62 games on tv,  with 17 of the games to be  simulcast on KDKA-TV.  The remaining 22 games, as well as some of the  early round playoff games, will be available by "subscription tv" only. To receive the games, you'll have to pay a one time hook up fee, and then a monthly fee of $11-12 dollars.  Also, under the new deal, there will no longer be radio/tv  simulcasts.  There will be a TV broadcast team, and a radio broadcast team.    No word on who the announcers will be.  Mike Lange and Paul Steigerwald are both under contract with KDKA, but their contracts expire at the end of this season.  KBL President Bill Craig said he'd like to hire Lange and Steigerwald.

This >also means that Christ had all of the legal rights of a decendant of >David as according to at least Roman law (and possibly Mosaic law as >well, but I am not sure) Joseph was Christ's LEGAL FATHER.  The argument for Luke's genealogy being that of Mary is very weak. According to Luke 3:23     And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about     thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph,    the son of Eli,  Aside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possible interpretations: either Joseph was her father or he was her brother. Clearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the son of Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man to whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping at straws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no intention of tracing Mary's genealogy (in which case he would have named her) but that he traces her husband's, from David's son Nathan.  The Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David's son, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew 1:16 reads:     And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born    Jesus, who is called Christ.   There are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile the two paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David, Solomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Joseph relavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph was not Jesus's physical father, then the original poster is quite correct, that claims for Jesus's messianic heritage are not based on truth but only on appearances, whatever Jesus's divine nature was.  The second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was not involved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a Holy Spirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also capable of employing the physical agency of Joseph's seed in this work.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss solely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of purity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is that neither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (they had not "known"each other).  Thus the first gospel's dedication of half its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant to Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.  To the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more problems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating  the births of two entirely different children of two entirely different sets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and  the birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two  stories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years later with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered his explanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge with their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive his resolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external documents, and the discussion of "how this could be" might bring us beyond the limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, the details are described in Steiner's "The Spiritual Guidance of the Human  Being and of Humanity", "The Gospel of St. Luke", and "The Gospel of St. Matthew".   Whether or not Rudolf Steiner's methods and explanation are accepted as valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent contradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.  As for the passing of one's Jewishness through the mother, this was never an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Mary's Jewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal line of descent from David, the king.  Gerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)

All your article reflects is your abundant ignorance. The people of  Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never  abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally  hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole  perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July  15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop  Makarios.  Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with  the aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right  given by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently  and conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For  those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island  since 1571.   The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the 'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences  for this irresponsible conduct.               THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM  2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, Cyprus  It is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving at the Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched against the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat Ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally killed in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage Greeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the 24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which has been converted into a museum.  AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY GREEK TERRORISTS  The date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the Greeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been going on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men and children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal Area of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage bloodshed...  The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent, are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the bathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their home. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.  Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by Mr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded during the same terrible event.  "On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan. Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs. Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting having supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River direction started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain. Thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was dangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought would be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We waited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing in the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her arms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open. Greeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house with  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard voices saying, in  Greek, "You want Taksim eh!"  and then bullets started flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children fell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks, who broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I heard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.  When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and her three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what had happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to the  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was brutally murdered.  In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying "Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?"  I became terrified. I thought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not dead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself under the double-bed.  An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My mouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some water. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the bathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I offered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who were all wounded.  We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I thought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed to be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber and I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked as far as Koshklu Chiftlik.  There, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were operated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs. Ayshe and her daughter.  After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to Ankara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months treatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus, Greeks arrested me at the Airport.  All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my detention. They then released me."  ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER  We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in which 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five days.  We  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some terrible sights.  In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A child's bicycle lay in a corner.  In the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three children piled on top of their murdered mother.  In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the head.  This, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose family had been killed by the mob in the first violence.  Today was five days later, and still they lay there.  Rene MacCOLL and Daniel McGEACHIE, (From the "DAILY EXPRESS")  "...I saw in  a bathroom the bodies of a  mother and three infant children murdered because their father was a Turkish Officer..."  Max CLOS, LE FIGARO 25-26 January, 1964    Peter Moorhead reporting from the village of Skyloura, Cyprus.   Date : 1 January, 1964.    IL GIARNO (Italy)    THEY ARE TURK-HUNTING, THEY WANT TO EXTERMINATE THEM.   Discussions start in London; in Cyprus terror continues. Right now we  are witnessing the exodus of Turks from the villages. Thousands of people  abandoning homes, land, herds; Greek Cypriot terrorism is relentless. This   time, the rhetoric of the Hellenes and the bust of Plato do not suffice to   cover up barbaric and ferocious behaviors.   Article by Giorgo Bocca, Correspondent of Il Giorno  Date: 14 January 1964   DAILY HERALD (London)   AN APPALLING SIGHT  And when I came across the Turkish homes they were an appalling sight. Apart from the walls, they just did not exist. I doubt if a napalm bomb attack could have created more devastation. I counted 40 blackened brick and concrete shells that had once been homes. Each house had been deliberately fired by petrol. Under red tile roofs which had caved in, I found a twisted mass of bed springs, children's conts and cribs, and ankle deep grey ashes of what had once been chairs, tables and wardrobes.  In the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios, a mile away, I counted 16  wrecked and burned out homes. They were all Turkish Cypriot homes. From this village more than 100 Turkish Cypriots had also vanished.In neither village did I find a scrap of damage to any Greek Cypriot house.    DAILY TELEGRAPH (London)    GRAVES OF 12 SHOT TURKISH CYPRIOTS FOUND IN CYPRUS VILLAGE   Silent crowds gathered tonight outside the Red Crescent hospital in the  Turkish Sector of Nicosia, as the bodies of 9 Turkish Cypriots found  crudely buried outside the village of Ayios Vassilios, 13 miles away, were  brought to the hospital under the escort of the Parachute Regiment. Three   more bodies, including one of a woman, were discovered nearby but could  not be removed. Turkish Cypriots guarded by paratroops are still trying to   locate the bodies of 20 more believed to have been buried on the same site.   Serdar Argic                             'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                              might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                              and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

According to reports, if you don't have DOS yet, and don't have any utilities (QEMM, Stacker, PCTools, Norton, ...) then DOS6 may be worth it.   For people who have DOS5, and some sort of utility, DOS6 doesn't offer much.

It works on xterms. At least I have no problem with it. - Back to the original question:  I usually start new xterms by selecting the proper menu entry in my desktop menu. Here is a sample command:  	xterm -sl 999 -n ls12i -title ls12i -e rlogin ls12i &  The -n and -title options give the text for window and icon. As I use the tcsh (a wonderful extension of the csh), I can do the following:  I have an  	alias precmd echo -n '^[]2\;${HOST}:$cwd^G'  in my ~/.tcshrc. This is a special alias for tvtwm. It is executed each time before printing the prompt. So, I have the current host name and the current directory path in the title bar of my xterms.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------       ____                                                                       UniDo  /  Ingolf Markhof  University of Dortmund, LS Informatik XII           ___/   /                   P.O.

And you couldn't expect a good auto mated to a 1.3 L engine?  Most of the bigger cars are, however, sold with autos.

I am looking to buy 4 new p195-50r15 tires.. (R or HR). I don't have much to spend, but I would like a tire that will LAST. Does anyone have any experience with the following brands?  	Riken 	Falken	 	BFG	 	General	  There are others, but these I can find here for under $70.. Like I said, I am mostly interested in threadwear then speed, since I hardly get to drive them over 80 or 90 mph. Also, is it true that "noone will give you warranty on such tires", according to a tire dealer?  Finally, do HR tires last longer than R tires (threadwear again), or is that strictly a speed factor?

I'm not sure what the other guy (can't track down his post for his name) was talking about when he made the claim that cobralinks are not adjustable. They are.  There's a space between each link where the "teeth" of the  locking head notch in.  Thus, each link is a possible locking point.  Also, (and this is not applicable to hard-core thieves who cart around liquid nitrogen and oxy-acetylene torches) the cobralinks "LOOK" a lot more effective than kryptonite cable locks (IMHO) and I think the initial appearance effect is more relevant to bored-joyriders-nominally-adept-at- cracking-unsecured-bike deterrence, as long as the lock is nominally  functional.  Finally, I notice that when I ride with my leathers, harness boots, and the cobralinks slung across like a bandolier (BTW, I've crashed in the rain dressed like this and the lock didn't pulverize any vertebrae), cagers give me a much wider berth, don't hassle me, and tend to avoid any potentially inflammatory action at stoplights.  I love my cobralinks almost as much as I love my pre-80's Honda dinosaur. (I think I have a pavlovian drool reflex-I put the lock on (i.e., on my body) and I can feel the bike already shaking away).

People are constantly calling WFAN and WABC with (stuff like) "I was thinking, why don't the Yankees trade Kaminicki and Silvestri to Seattle for Ken Griffey Jr and Randy Johnson, that would really help the team"  or "Do you think the Yankees can get Roger  Clemens?".

The transformer is just that - a  transformer.  It's there primarily to step the voltage up or down.  (Although the inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is NOT negligible, as anyone who's zapped said transistor from either failing to get one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a "snubber" diode across it would tell you.  Actually, many transistors intended for switcher use today have the diode built in.)  The basic switched-mode power supply operates something like this (in a somewhat simplified manner):  The AC line is rectified to produce a high voltage, more-or-less unregulated DC rail.  The energy storage (or "filter") caps appear across this rail, as does the switching transistor. The transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer, resulting in stepped-up or stepped-down pulses out the secondary, which  are then rectified and filtered.  At least one of the transformer's outputs is sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor, which acts in a "pulse-width modulation" (PWM) fashion to control (by varying the pulse width) the amount of energy being dumped into the primary, and therefore the voltage coming out at the secondary.  The remaining outputs may be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will, more-or-less tracking the regulated output, or they may have some additional linear regulation added.  You may also note that the feedback between the  regulated output and the PWM control (which is most typically an IC) is not done via a direct electrical connection; this is due to various safety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to be electrically isolated.  Often, the feedback path involves an optoisolator to meet this requirement.  While the transformer isn't the primary energy-storage device in these designs, this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer can be ignored; besides the inductive "kick" giving the switch transistor a bad time (as noted above), you also need to worry about getting all the energy that went *in* to the transformer back *out* again, one way or another. In some designs, this happens more or less automatically - but in others, you need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core doesn't saturate, which again would have disastrous results (best left to the  imagination! :-)).  I'm NOT by any stretch of the imagination a power-supply designer;  hopefully, a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errors in the above.

We've kept things on a painfully polite, Christmas-card sort of level for most of this time. Attempts to see each other end disastrously, with his wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imagined slights to her, or his inattention or insensitivity to her (I mean, this'll happen by the end of a single restaurant meal). He seems, from what I've seen, to live in a state of quivering anxiety, hoping futilely to keep the next storm from breaking. He has sacrificed not only meaningful contact with us but also other friends and outside interests. Now, this is his choice, and I need to accept it even if I deplore it. But it's hard.    From time to time I've wanted to drop the pretense that we have a relationship--by cutting off contact--or trying to have a real if painful relationship, by talking honestly with him, but I've always thought, "Why be dramatic? And you know he'll only get evasive and then find some excuse to get off the phone. Just leave the door open, in case he ever decides to come back." It's been an unsatisfying choice, to allow us to go on with the superficial trappings of a relationship, but it was the best I could think of.    Now, this weekend, my mother finally decided that she wasn't going to pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. This was the outcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed and raved at my mother, blaming her for everything wrong in their lives, and in which my brother evaded, temporized, claimed the situation was beyond his control, and as always expected my mother to make all the allowances and concessions. Mom said she would not, that she would not quietly take abuse any more, and that if these were the terms of their relationship, she didn't want to talk to or see them any more. And she hung up. (I have never seem my mother lose her temper, and I think that this is the first time she's ever hung up on someone.) Mom says she feels as if she's divorced my brother, and that it's a relief in some ways to have the break out in the open and done with.       I have mixed feelings. I'm proud of Mom for sticking up for herself; angry at my brother and sister-in-law for hurting her, for being jerks, for persisting in such a wretched life, which hurts us all and is warping their children; angry at my sister-in-law for being so hateful, and angry at my brother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or us that he's willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying to appease an unappeasable, emotionally disturbed woman; pained for their children, who are a mess; scared for the future, since this marks the time when either things will change and improve or the break will become irrevocable; nastily self- righteous over this bit of proof that they can't "get away" with treating us or each other this way, and then disgusted with myself for even beginning to gloat over others' misery; and finally, mostly, sad, sad, sad, to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister-in-law trapped in a horrible, destructive situation that they can't see a way out of--or they can't bear to take whatever paths they do see. And I'm frustrated because I don't know what if anything to do, and doing nothing drives me up the wall. I try to pray, about my own feelings of rage, impotence, and vindictiveness, and about their situation, but I am not free of the desire to *DO* something concrete. (The desire to *DO* something, to define a problem and fix it, is one of my besetting vices; I'm having a terrible time quieting down my internal mental chatter enough to listen for God.)   Do you thoughtful and kind people on the net have advice for me? Is this a time to reach out to my brother? To let things be? How can I conquer my rage AT him enough to be there FOR him?   Here's the big question I've been evading throughout this long, long post: Is it ok, as a Christian and a proponent of faith, hope, and charity, to accept the destruction of a relationship? To give up on my own brother, or at least to accept that I am powerless to help him and can only wait and see what happens? Do please answer--by e-mail or post.   Thank you.

I won't start panicking until/unless DES or RSA or stuff like that is prohibited, but I'm a little anxious.  (No doubt it won't be long before someone posts explaining how this just a small part of some far-ranging and long-lived NSA-PKP-IRS-FBI-CIA-HandgunControlInc-Clinton conspiracy to subvert freedom, democracy, and mathematics.)  My feeling is that the administration probably isn't that worried about things like DES and RSA and PGP and RIPEM, since they'll never be used by a group much wider than us computer geeks.  The fact that this just came out now suggests one of two things:  1.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, and it only just     now happened to be ``ready'' to release to the world at this time.  2.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, but wasn't able     to get the Bush administration to go along with this plan.  (I     find it unlikely that this would have been because of a sympathy     for the unescrowed use of cryptography; more likely the     administration felt that even escrowed, secret-algorithm and, for     all we know, trivially breakable cryptography should not be made     widely available.)

At the same time this technology preserves the >ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to >intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   The majority of the discussion involving this "Clipper Chip" seems to pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations.  Does anyone know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog signals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.  The main thing I just don't get is whether this chip implements symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques.  Anybody know?  I'm guessing symmetric, but they don't get very clear about it.  If it is symmetric, how is it useful for anything other than link-level encryption with an identical chip at each end?  How can you negotiate a per-session key using symmetric cryptography without using a trusted third party who knows your key?  (Or does it even use a per-session key?)  If it's asymmetric, what about PKP's patents, which they claim cover all methods of doing asymmetric cryptography?  Are they getting royalties, or is hiding infringement the real reason for keeping the algorithm secret? :-) -- Marc VanHeyningen   mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu   MIME & RIPEM accepted Kirk:  I won't hurt you.

For example, I might decide before going to sleep that I want to repeat a favourite dream, or dream about a specific place.  Or if I am having an unpleasant dream, I can often (not always) redirect events to something more pleasant.  I guess I think that the same standards apply in these "directed" dreams as apply in waking fantasies or real life (ref Jesus teaching about looking at a woman lustfully being the same a committing adultary).  When my normal dreams display themes that I would not conciously chose to dream about, I take that as a sign that all is not well with my "inner life" - maybe I have underlying tenstions/fears that need to be resolved, or maybe its straightforward sin.  In either case, the cause needs to be resolved.    In fact, either case is pretty rare.  I don't often remember dreams that I don't chose to have.  When I do, they almost always tell me something important. I also almost never dream in pictures, and especially not in colour (in fact I've had precisely one full colour picture dream that I can remember, and it was definately spiritually important) I tend to dream in sound, with the odd blurred image, in black and white.  Interesting topic - I'll be fascinated to read other responses.  Alison  PS. Just to make it clear, I don't do ( and have never tried ) OOBEs.     I tend to think they are off limits for Christians.

I wonder why you say that?  I don't see why having a spouse and/or kids would have anything to do with it.  It might if you brought your kids to the game and wanted them to get home in time to get to bed at a reasonable hour (in which case I'd probably decide to take my kids to games on weekends, as many people do, or else be prepared to leave the game early), but from what you say later on, you don't bring your kids *or* your spouse to the game. As it happens, I have a husband but no kids, and my husband usually attends games with me.  >Extra innings could put me >well past midnight.

I can see it's a problem if you don't bring your wife to the ballgame, but that's a problem even if the game goes a trim 2 1/2 hours.  As far as bagging work the next day, I don't really understand why that's necessary, unless going to a game also means that you consume vast quantities of beer (I note that this is the case for many guys).

Look: if I pay between $8.00 and $20.00 apiece for tickets, plus $10.00  for parking, plus spending my time and energy driving to and from Boston,  plus spending additional money on concessions etc. at the ballpark, then  I see going to a game as a considerable investment of time and money. I can't afford to go to a lot of games.  Hence, going to a game is a big deal, like going to a play or an opera.  Maybe you have more money than  I do and can go to games all year long, so it's not such a big deal for you.   But I'm not interested in having games "sped up", any more than I want to have _Die Walkure_ cut down to a convenient "weeknight version" of two hours.  If I felt that going to a night game during the week would interfere  with my family life or my work life, then I'd choose to go to a weekend game.  IMPO.  Heather HHENDERSON@vax.clarku.edu

Even if one believes that religion is "primitive,  simple-minded and unscientific, anti-intellectual and childish", one can still hold the view that religion also adds an unnecessary level of complexity to the explanation.

There are five inputs signals: RD, DSR, DCD, CTS, and RI.  There are many differnt null modem requiremts as dictated by the software. The IBM BIOS requires asserts DTR and RTS and then waits for both DSR and CTS before sending.  When a BIOS recieve call is made, it asserts DTR and waits for DSR to become true (times out after a while and returns with an error if DSR never becomes true).  It requires CTS to be true for sending AND recieving.  Most communications packages bypass this and replace it with their own protocol.  The key is that each comm. package could very well have different requirements.  My favorite cable works in many cases: short RTS to CTS at each end, but also run RTS through to DCD at the opposite end.  TD runs through to RD and DTR runs through to DSR from both DTE's and of course SG goes through to SG.  I have never had trouble with this null modem even though I have used it with a comm. package that was expecting RTS to go to CTS instead of DCD. The advantage of this cable is that it also works with the IBM BIOS.  Gordon Lang

Hmm, here are a couple:  1) If the algorithm becomes known, it will be easy to produce pin-compatible non-crippled chips that provide -real- encryption and privacy, because their keys are only in their users' hands.  2) Since SkipJack is a symmetric key cypher, it needs some way to agree on a session key. The released information says that any protocol may be used (e.g., DH). From a theoretical point of view, this is probably true. However, from a practical point of view, those chips must have some kind of key exchange protocol built-in. What if it is good old RSA? This will mean that the producer will have to pay lots of bucks to PKP. By keeping the details secret this can be avoided...

Between Adam and Eve and Golgotha the whole process of the fall of man occurred.  This involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual world.  This is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples through history.  The Greek, for example, could say, "better a beggar in the land of the living than a king in the land of the dead." (Iliad, I think).  The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is an ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to conscign Adam or Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.  Yet they all died in their sins, in the Christian sense.  The same can be said of the whole of  Gentile humanity, and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next to him.  I do not limit the power of Christ to save even him, through whom Satan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment.  >In my studies >of the ancient mystery reliegions, I have run across many poems or rituals or >what nots with the interpretation that those who are of God will be with Him >via the promised seed but those who rebel will suffer *eternal* life in dieing. > It was a standard belief back then.    It is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  The relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely extended conditions of Greenwich mean time. It is possible to imagine an eternity of agony or bliss - or even many of them - in the spiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth.  It was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous were lost. This again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness that fled from us after the fall, with our ever increasing involvement with the sense world.  It would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient people's ideas of life after death.  >                                    Today we think we know so much and that >if we could go back in time we could sure teach those people a thing or two.  >But I think that as this age has grown older that it is we who opperate from a >mist, not those of the older ages. >  Mankind fell into mist and darkness, and at "the turning point of time" a new light entered into the world.  The light still grows, and we are developing the eyes with which to see by it.  Much new revelation and growth in under- standing lies before us.  Our new vision and understanding is still very feeble, but it contains something new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and much more as well.  (At this point I should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of Rudolf Steiner, founder of Anthroposophy, for  many insights that have led me to my views on this subject).  >I have said it before, I'd love to post on this but the vulcan hammer would >fall.

THe writings and the archeological >finds plainly show its origin and the whys and wherefores of this doctine.    The way you refer to it as "doctrine" puts a modern intellectual coloring on it. I think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually concrete, a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or teachings today can be received.  I am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to simple dispersion from an original source.  Even if they were passed on, the question is, to what extent did they reflect real perception and experience?  The similarity in the midst of great variety of expression of the different people's ideas of the time immediately after death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality.  In any case, we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of Euclid, but by contemplating the principles themselves.  On the other hand, there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianity that originated most definitely in a pagan source.  The idea that the human being consists essentially of soul only, and that the soul is created at birth, was consciously adopted from Aristotle, whose ideas dominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does today. He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our eternal spiritual being had grown dim.  >maybe at sometime in the future-    Indeed. I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternal irrevocable damnation is a real possibility.  But the narrow range in which we conceive of the decisive moment, i.e. after the end of a single earthly life, is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the reality, and I think that is why the early creeds were couched in terms that did not try to spell it out.  >Rex  Gerry (73237.2006@compuserve.com)

I will upload this package to SIMTEL20 later.  ******   You may distribute this program freely for non-commercial use          if no fee is gained. ******   There is no warranty. The author is not responsible for any          damage caused by this program.  Important changes since Version 1.35:   Added support for IRIS.   Support Mix/Concat. two images.   Added support for 'batch conversion'.   Added support for 'load/save palette table'.   Added support for 'edge enhance'.   Added support for 'crop one line'.   Added support for 'negate image'.   New color quantization option.   Fix some minor bugs.  (1) Introduction:   This program can let you READ, WRITE and DISPLAY images with different   formats. It also let you do some special effects(ROTATION, DITHERING ....)   on image. Its main purpose is to let you convert image among different   formts.   Include simple file management system.   Support 'slide show'. + Support 'batch conversion'.   There is NO LIMIT on image size.   Currently this program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.   If you want to use HiColor or TrueColor, you must have VESA driver.   If you want to modify video driver, please read section (8).   (2) Hardware Requirement:   PC 386 or better. MSDOS 3.3 or higher.   min amount of ram is 4M bytes(Maybe less memory will also work).   (I recommend min 8M bytes for better performance).   Hard disk for swapping(virtual memory).

(7) Detail:     Initialization:       Set default display type to highest display type.       Find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only).     1. When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this       menu you can press any function key. If you move or copy       files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like       'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory.       The header line in 'read' menu includes "(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)".         d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.       pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use         for reading current file.       pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This         program will automatically determine which format this file is.         The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check         standard extension. Still fail, report error.       pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'.         If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key           (except ESCAPE).         If any error occurs, program will make a beep. +       'w' or 'W' to pause, any key to continue.         ESCAPE to terminate.       pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type.       pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting. +     pressing F5 will turn on 'effect' menu.     2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.       You can do special effect on image.       pressing RETURN: show image.         in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text         mode.       pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do         special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.       pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.       pressing SPACE: save current image to file.         B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).         Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits).         Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).         True Color: save as 24-bit image.          This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image         to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program         will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another         directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after         pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change         directory to what you want. Then,          pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.         pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename                       (filename under bar).     3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.    4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,      the performance is poor.    5. If you want to save 8 bits image :        try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...       If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):        try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster        (No one is better for true 24bits image)    6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.    7. Not all subroutines are fully tested    8. This document is not well written. If you have any PROBLEM, SUGGESTION,      COMMENT about this program,      Please send to u7711501@bicmos.ee.nctu.edu.tw (140.113.11.13).      I need your suggestion to improve this program.      (There is NO anonymous ftp on this site)   (8) Tech. information:   Program (user interface and some subroutines) written by Jih-Shin Ho.   Some subroutines are borrowed from XV(2.21) and PBMPLUS(dec 91).   Tiff(V3.2) and Jpeg(V4) reading/writing are through public domain     libraries.   Compiled with DJGPP.   You can get whole DJGPP package from SIMTEL20 or mirror sites.     For example, wuarchive.wustl.edu: /mirrors/msdos/djgpp   (9) For Thoese who want to modify video driver:    1. get GRX source code from SIMTEL20 or mirror sites.    2. For HiColor and TrueColor:         15 bits : # of colors is set to 32768.         16 bits : # of colors is set to 0xc010.         24 bits : # of colors is set to 0xc018.   Acknowledgment:   I would like to thank the authors of XV and PBMPLUS for their permission     to let me use their subroutines.   Also I will thank the authors who write Tiff and Jpeg libraries.   Thank DJ. Without DJGPP I can't do any thing on PC.                                               Jih-Shin Ho                                    u7711501@bicmos.ee.nctu.edu.tw

It's the one that sometimes sweeps schools or boot camp.  It is contagious and kills by attacking the covering of the brain, causing the blood vessels to thrombose and the brain to swell up.  It is very treatable if caught in time.  There isn't much time, however.  The rash is the tip off.  Infants are very susceptible to dying from bacterial meningitis.

Now, when I buy over the net and pick up the shipping costs, I'll specify that I only pick up the normal UPS charges (as if delivered directly to UPS), as I've been burned by $10 shipping charges for a $2.49 pkg. I will never use a mailing service unless I don't have the right box and the buyer needs whatever IMMEDIATELY. I'll also tell the person, if they agreed to pick up shipping, what is going on.  Other things to watch out for/consider:  	The rates are $5 to $30 higher than UPS direct.  	For a non-UPS (truck) package, they quoted a rate 	of $85. Fed Ex economy air was only $85 for the 	same weight! RPS (a trucking package company, in many 	cities) only wanted $18. Guess who got it. The Mailbox 	operator told me I was not telling the truth about 	competitors' rates, said RPS was unreliable (I've used them 	before with NO problems), etc. Right.  	A COD check goes to the mailing service. Our local 	Mailbox then takes its sweet time mailing me the 	remade check. All this for an additional $3.00 over the 	UPS COD charge. What a deal.... :-)  	For packages over $100, they charge you about double over 	what UPS charges them for insurance. I've never had 	a claim, but other netters (is Ralph Seguin out there?) 	have told horror stories about them...  	All package traces have to be done through Mailbox by 	Mailbox.  	Our local Mailbox operator told me I was lying when I 	asked him why their rates were stratospheric compared 	to direct UPS. Does he ever check? Probably not...  	Their UPS ground rates come close to Fed Ex's economy 	air rate, and Fed Ex will pick up!  	UPS will pick up for a $5 charge in most areas! 	 --  --------------------------------------------------------------------        Dave Medin			Phone:	(205) 730-3169 (w)     SSD--Networking				(205) 837-1174 (h)     Intergraph Corp.

First of all, when I'm talking about ``factoring the modulus'' or a ``breakthrough in factoring'', what I really mean is a breakthrough in the cryptanalysis of RSA.  I know that factoring and breaking RSA are not proven to be equivalent; it's just so damn convenient not to repeat this every time.  I also have to admit that I don't really know if the ``non-group'' property of a cipher is essential only for key chaining.  I have thought about it a little while, but I can't find a way that a cryptanalyst could exploit a group structure.  That, of course, means nothing at all.  Then I wrote,  >Please note that as long as it is much harder to factor a RSA modulus >than it is to generate it, the increase in computer speed alone will >keep key lengths and modulus factoring in lock-step, i.e., people will >simply start using longer moduli and still be safe.  What I meant was that as long as the only advantage of the cryptanalyst is a faster computer, then we will probably have RSA for a long time to come, because even if 1024-bit moduli somehow could be broken with fast computers (not with a new algorithm), then people would simply use longer moduli.  Both users and cryptanalysts benefit from better technology in the same way.  Hope this keeps the flames away...  Have fun.  --  Stephan <neuhaus@informatik.uni-kl.de> sig closed for inventory.

For you, or the government, or anyone else to say what is dangerous or harmful to the followers is direct interference in religion; it has been used quite improperly even when nothing as drastic as Waco has happened.  No evidence has been presented that the Davidians have engaged in any  activities harmful to others before the actions of the BATF.  On this morning's news, there was an item about the BATF warrant being unsealed. That they bought $200,000 worth of LEGAL weapons has not been denied by anyone.  When they were accused of harming others in the past, the local sherriff had no problems in serving a warrant; our rights as free people were violated by the BATF going in shooting.

In his infinite wisdom, he made it perfectly clear that if we don't live according to his rules, we will burn in hell. Well, with what RIGHT can god make that desicion? Let's say, for the sake of argument, that god creates every one of us (directly or indirectly, it doesn't matter.). What then happens, is that he first creates us, and then turns us lose. Well, I didn't ask to be created.   Let's make an analogue. If a scientist creates a unique living creature (which has happened, it was even patented...!!!), does he then have the right to expect it to behave in a certain matter, or die...?  Who is god to impose its rules on us ? Who can tell if god is REALLY so righteous as god likes us to believe? Are all christians a flock of sheep, unable to do otherwise that follow the rest?

It's not biology at all, it's clothing design.  Women's clothing is generally designed to be as non-functional as possible.  It's only been in the last five years or so that you could buy women's pants with pockets deep enough to carry anything in.  Previously, deep pockets were virtually unknown in women's clothing.  Skirts generally have better pockets now, too.  Dresses, espcially fancy dresses, are still pretty hopeless.  I often hand my driver's license over to my husband if we're dressed up to go out somewhere, so I don't have to be encumbered by a purse.  If women consistently bought functional clothing, and boycotted the manufacturers who refuse to make functional women's clothing, I think manufacturers would tend to bow to market pressures.  There's an interesting chapter in Susan Faludi's Backlash that described what happened the LAST time clothing manufacturers ignored the need for functional women's clothing.  The manufactuing industry lost millions.

Here goes...  I am getting married in June to  a devout (Wisconsin Synod) Lutheran.  I would classify myself as a strong  agnostic/weak athiest.  This has been a a subject of many discussions between us and is really our only real obstacle.  We don't have any real difficulties  with the religious differences yet, but I expect they will pop up when we have  children.  I have agreed to raise the children "nominally" Lutheran.  That is, Lutheran traditions, but trying to keep an open mind.  I am not sure if this is even possible though.  I feel that that the worst quality of being devoutly religous is the lack of an open mind.       Anyway, I guess I'll get on with my question.  Is anyone in the same  situation and can give some suggestions as to how to deal with this?  We've  taken the attitude so far of just talking about it a lot and not letting  anything get bottled up inside.  Sometimes I get the feeling we're making this  much bigger than it actually is.

This is   a very good dirt bike and has been maintained perfectly.  I never had   any problems with it.    It's a four stroke, 4 valves, liquid cooled engine. It is heavier than    a 250 2 stroke but still lighter than a Honda XR600 and has a lot better    suspension (Ohlins shock, Husky fork) than the XR. For the casual or non   competitive rider, the engine is much better than any two stroke.   You can easily lug up hills and blast through trails with minimum gear   changes.      The 1992 ignition and the carefully tuned carburation makes this bike   very easy to start (starts of first kick when cold or hot).  There is a   custom made carbon/kevlar (light 1 pound) wrap around skid plate to protect   the engine cases and the water pump.  The steering angle has been reduced    by 2 degree to increase steering quickness. This with the suspension tune-up   by Phil Douglas of Aftershock (Multiple time ISDE rider) gives it a better   ride than most bike: plush suspension, responsive steering with no head shake.    So if it is such a good bike why sell it???? Gee, I want to buy a Husaberg,   which just a husky but 25 pounds lighter... and a tad more $$$.

Message-ID: <mrsC5sE7F.1E6@netcom.com> Organization: McAfee Associates Distribution: usa Date: Tue, 20 Apr 1993 14:42:50 GMT Lines: 48  Greetings,     Specious reasoning alert!  Sorry folks, I don't like gun control too much, but this is just too crazy.      1)  The main gun control law is similar to (or even BASED ON) a German gun control law.      2)  Germany was Controlled With Evil Nazi's at the time.      3)  Nazi's are bad.      Therefore gun control is bad!  (If this seems reasonable to you, try reading it as GunControlIsANaziPlot!  That's pretty much what it's saying.)      Look, let's try to beat gun control with reason and sense, not by trying to appeal to emotions, and threatening conspiracies.  Denounce GCA '68 as wrong because it's WRONG, not because it's based off of a law from someone else's government.      As for the 'Lots Of Brave Men Died Fighting Nazi's, So Their Laws Have No Place On Our Books!'  Well, lots of brave men died fighting England.  Wanna bet we've got lots of English laws on our books?  Oh, but they're our ALLIES now, so everything's hunky-dory.  I'm *VERY* sure that the GCA is not the only law that we have on the books which is similar, or even based on, a law on the german books.  HOWEVER, that does not give invalidation in and of itself.      WE, THE PEOPLE, must state that we find the law unappealing and contrary to our freedom.  We must use logic, and reason, and compelling arguments.  To use emotion, and appeal to fear is to lower yourselves to the level of your enemies.      A side issue...  When talking about the Amendments, it bothers me to see people acting as if they empower them, but require no responsibility from them.  Free speech also assumes restraint, well armed militia expects well TRAINED militia, the right to vote expects the citizen to try to become educated enough to make a reasonable decision.  You are not granted these rights without any responsibility to the society that offers them.  You have a responsibility in return, and it's to do more than bitch.                                                       --  Morgan Schweers --  Hacker, Furry, SFFan, gamer, writer, MUDder, climber.  24 hours isn't enough! mrs@netcom.com   | Finger mrs@netcom.com or mrs@mcafee.com for my PGP 2.1 key!| New chrome grass! \ B1 S4 a b g j++! k l? p r- s t+ u v- w+ x y- z, approx.__/ Low-level D&D monsters practicing war games @ night.

Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and  Intensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses  each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin  June 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours  per day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.   Fellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact  Steven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology Management Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or address below.   ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO  UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.        ####################################################################### #################   New Program Announcement   ######################## #######################################################################               JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM  The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon  University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific  communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and  January 1994.   PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the  United States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is  facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.   PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to  develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:  1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time.  2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in  manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a  variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology, Sociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums will be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or  research facilities in the United States will be scheduled.   3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU,  participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe, and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan will generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.   FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS STIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.
